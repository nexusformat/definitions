# Legacy versions of NeXus definitions documentation

Per the [NeXus release procedure](http://manual.nexusformat.org/installation.html?highlight=semantic#nexus-definitions), 
this directory contains legacy copies of the PDF rendition of the NeXus definitions documentation.  (Retaining multiple versions
of the HTML would become tedious and clutter the current repository.)

The versions are named thus `nexus-<tag>-<yyyy-mm-dd>-<7-char-hash>.pdf` so that they may be identified directly to 
a particular tag, date, and commit and also so they sort chronologically.

The [release procedure](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/wiki/Release-Procedure) is documented in this wiki.  For background, see [issue 521](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/521).
