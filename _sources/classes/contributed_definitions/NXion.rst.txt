**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Set of atoms of a molecular ion or fragment in e.g. ToF mass spectrometry.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_ivecmax**: Maximum number of atoms/isotopes allowed per (molecular) ion (fragment).

  **n_ranges**: Number of mass-to-charge-state-ratio range intervals for ion type.

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXion/ion_type-field:

  .. index:: ion_type (field)

  **ion_type**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

    Ion type (ion species) identifier. The identifier zero
    is reserved for the special unknown ion type.

  .. _/NXion/isotope_vector-field:

  .. index:: isotope_vector (field)

  **isotope_vector**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_ivecmax]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

    A vector of isotope hash values.
    These values have to be stored in an array, sorted in decreasing order.
    The array is filled with zero hash values indicating unused places.
    The individual hash values are built with the following hash function:

    The hash value :math:`H` is :math:`H = Z + N*256` with :math:`Z`
    the number of protons and :math:`N` the number of neutrons
    of each isotope respectively.

    Z and N have to be 8-bit unsigned integers.
    For the rationale behind this `M. Kühbach et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_

  .. _/NXion/charge_state-field:

  .. index:: charge_state (field)

  **charge_state**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

    Signed charge state of the ion in multiples of electron charge.

    Only positive values will be measured in atom probe microscopy as the
    ions are accelerated by a negatively signed bias electric field.
    In the case that the charge state is not explicitly recoverable,
    the value should be set to zero.

    In atom probe microscopy this is for example the case when using
    classical range file formats like RNG, RRNG for atom probe data.
    These file formats do not document the charge state explicitly.
    They report the number of atoms of each element per molecular ion
    surplus the mass-to-charge-state-ratio interval.
    With this it is possible to recover the charge state only for
    specific molecular ions as the accumulated mass of the molecular ion
    is defined by the isotopes, which without knowing the charge leads
    to an underconstrained problem.
    Details on ranging can be found in the literature: `M. K. Miller <https://doi.org/10.1002/sia.1719>`_

  .. _/NXion/name-field:

  .. index:: name (field)

  **name**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Human-readable ion type name (e.g. Al +++)
    The string should consists of ASCII UTF-8 characters, 
    ideally using LaTeX notation to specify the isotopes, ions, and charge
    state. Examples are 12C + or Al +++.
    Although this name may be human-readable and intuitive, parsing such
    names becomes impractical for more complicated cases. Therefore, the
    isotope_vector should be the preferred machine-readable format to use.

  .. _/NXion/mass_to_charge_range-field:

  .. index:: mass_to_charge_range (field)

  **mass_to_charge_range**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [n_ranges, 2]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    Associated lower (mqmin) and upper (mqmax) bounds of 
    mass-to-charge-state ratio interval(s) [mqmin, mqmax]
    (boundaries included) for which the respective ion is labelled
    as an ion of the here referred to ion_type.
