      .. collapse:: Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlation is the process of building logica ...

          Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlation is the process of building logical
          relations between volumetric features based on meshes, their proximity and
          eventual intersections. Volumetric overlap and proximity of volumetric
          features is identified for members of sets of features to members of
          other sets of volumetric features.
          Specifically, for each time step k pairs of sets are compared:
          Members of a so-called current_set to members of a so-called next_set.
          Members can be different types of volumetric features.
          In the analysis of M. Kuehbach et al. specifically features can be
          so-called objects (closed non-degnerated polyhedra representing watertight
          parts of an e.g. iso-surface) and/or proxies. Proxies are computed
          doppelganger/replacement meshes for parts of an iso-surface which initially
          were not resulting in watertight meshes because objects at the edge
          of the dataset or incompletely measured or truncated objects.

            Specifies the method whereby to decide if two objects intersect volumetrically.
            For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of
            `M. Kühbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_, the tool by
            default assumes that two objects intersect if they share at least one
            ion with the same evaporation ID (shared_ion).
            Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections,
            the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to 
            tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks
            for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra to identify if two objects
            intersect or not.

            However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
            cases which the currently used library (TetGen) was not unable to
            tetrahedralize successfully. These cases were virtually always
            associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra which had portions
            of the mesh that were connected by almost point like tubes of triangles.
            Finding more robust methods for computing intersections between
            not necessarily convex polyhedra might improve the situation in the future.

            objects are coprecipitates in the sense that they are single,
            duplet, triplet, or high-order. For these analyses to work

              It is assumed that the members within all these FEATURE sets
              are representing a set together. As an example this set might represent
              all volumetric_features. However, users might have formed
              a subset of this set where individuals were regrouped.
              For paraprobe-nanochem this is the case for objects and proxies.
              Specifically, objects are distinguished further into those far
