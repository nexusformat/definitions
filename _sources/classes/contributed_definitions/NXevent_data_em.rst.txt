  .. collapse:: Metadata and settings of an electron microscope for scans and images. ...

      Metadata and settings of an electron microscope for scans and images.

      The need for such a structuring of data is evident from the fact that
      electron microscopes are dynamic. Oftentimes it suffices to calibrate the
      instrument at the start of the session. Subsequently, data (images, spectra, etc.)
      can be collected. Users may wish to take only a single scan or image and
      complete their microscope session; however

      frequently users are working much longer at the microscope, recalibrate and take
      multiple data items (scans, images, spectra). Each item comes with own detector
      and eventually on-the-fly processing settings and calibrations.

      For the single data item use case one may argue that the need for an additional
      grouping is redundant. Instead, the metadata could equally be stored inside
      the respective groups of the top-level mandatory NXinstrument group.
      On the flip side, even for a session with a single image, it would also not
      harm to nest the data.

      In fact, oftentimes scientists feel that there is a need to store details
      about eventual drift of the specimen in its holder (if such data is available)
      or record changes to the lens excitations or apertures used and/or changed.
      Although current microscopes are usually equipped with stabilization
      systems for many of the individual components, it can still be useful
      to store time-dependent data in detail.

      Another reason if not a need for having more finely granularizable options for
      storing time-dependent data, is that over the course of a session one may
      reconfigure the microscope. What is a reconfiguration? This could be the
      change of an aperture mode because a scientist may first collect an image
      with some aperture and then pick a different value and continue.
      As the aperture affects the electron beam, it will affect the system.

      Let aside for a moment the technology and business models, an EM could be
      monitored (and will likely become so more in the future) for streaming out
      spatio-temporal details about its components, locations of (hardware components) and objects within the region-of-interest. Eventually external stimuli are applied
      and the specimen repositioned.

      Some snapshot or integrated data from this stream are relevant for understanding
      signal genesis and electron/ion-beam-sample interaction (paths). In such a generic
      case it might be necessary to sync these streaming data with those intervals
      in time when specific measurements are taken (spectra collected,
      images taken, diffraction images indexed on-the-fly).

      Therefore, both the instrument and specimen should always be considered as dynamic.
      Scientists often report or feel (difficult to quantify) observations that
      microscopes *perform differently* across sessions, without sometimes being
      able to identify clear root causes. Users of the instrument may consider
      such conditions impractical, or *too poor* and thus either abort their session
      or try to bring the microscope first into a state where conditions are considered
      more stable, better, or of some whatever high enough quality to reuse
      data collection.

      In all these cases it is practical to have a mechanism how time-dependent data
      of the instrument state can be stored and documented in a interoperable way.
      Where should these data be stored? With NeXus these data should not only be
      stored in the respective instrument component groups of the top-level NXinstrument.
      The reason is that this group should be reserved for as stable as possible
      quantities which do not change over the session. Thereby we can avoid to store
      repetitively that there is a certain gun or detector available but just store
      the changes. This is exactly what the em_lab group is for inside NXevent_data_em.

      Ideally, NXevent_data_em are equipped with a start_time and end_time
      to represent a time interval (remind the idea of the instrument state stream)
      during which the scientist considered (or practically has to consider)
      the microscope (especially ebeam and specimen) as stable enough.

      Arguably it is oftentimes tricky to specify a clear time interval when the
      microscope is stable enough. Take for instance the acquisition of an image
      or spectra stack. It is not fully possible (technically) to avoid that even
      within a single image instabilities of the beam are faced and drift occurs.
      Maybe in many cases this these instabilities are irrelevant but does this
      warrant to create a data schema where either the microscope state can only
      be stored very coarsely or one is forced to store it very finely?

      This is a question of how one wishes to granularize pieces of information.
      A possible solution is to consider each probed position, i.e. point in time
      when the beam was not blanked and thus when the beam illuminates a portion of
      the material, i.e. the interaction volume, whose signal contributions are then
      counted by the one or multiple detector(s) as per pixel- or per voxel signal
      in the region-of-interest.
      NXevent_data_em in combination with the NXem application definition
      allows researchers to document this. Noteworty to mention is that we understand
      that in many cases realizing such a fine temporal and logical granularization
      and data collection is hard to achieve in practice.

      A frequently made choice, mainly for convenience, is that drift and scan distortions
      are considered a feature or inaccuracy of the image and/or spectrum and thus
      one de facto accepts that the microscope was not as stable as expected during
      the acquisition of the image. We learn that the idea of a time interval
      during the microscope session may be interpreted differently by different
      users. Here we consider the choice to focus on images and spectra, and eventually
      single position measurements as the smallest granularization level.
      Which eventually may require to add optional NXprocess instances for respectively
      collected data to describe the relevant distortions. Nevertheless, the distortions
      are typically corrected for by numerical protocols. This fact warrants to
      consider the distortion correction a computational workflow which can be
      modelled as a chain of NXprocess instances each with own parameters.  an own 
      A more detailed overview of such computational steps to cope with scan distortions
      is available in the literature:

      * `C. Ophus et al. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.12.002>`_  
      * `B. Berkels et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.12.016>`_  
      * `L. Jones et al. <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40679-015-0008-4>`_

      For specific simulation purposes, mainly in an effort to digitally repeat
      or simulate the experiment, it is tempting to consider dynamics of the
      instrument, implemented as time-dependent functional descriptions of
      e.g. lens excitations, beam shape functions, trajectories of groups of
      electrons, or detector noise models.

      For now the preferred strategy to handle these cases is through
      customizations of the specific fields within NXevent_data_em instances.

      Another alternative could be to sample finer, eventually dissimilarly along
      the time axi; however this may cause situations where an NXevent_data_em
      instance does not contain specific measurements (i.e. images, spectra of
      scientific relevance).

      In this case one should better go for a customized application definition
      with a functional property description inside members (fields or groups)
      in NXevent_data_em instances; or resort to a specific offspring application
      definition of NXem which documents metadata for tracking explicitly electrons
      (with ray-tracing based descriptors/computational geometry descriptors)
      or tracking of wave bundles.

      This perspective on much more subtle time-dependent considerations of electron
      microscopy can be advantageous also for storing details of time-dependent
      additional components that are coupled to and/or synced with a microscope.

      Examples include cutting-edge experiments where the electron beam gets
      coupled/excited by e.g. lasers. In this case, the laser unit should be
      registered under the top-level NXinstrument section. Its spatio-temporal
      details could be stored inside respective additional groups of the NXinstrument
      though inside instances of here detailed NXevent_data_em.
