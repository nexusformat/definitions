**Status**:

  application definition, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  An application definition for optical spectroscopy experiments.

**Symbols**:

  Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.

  **N_spectrum**: Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured data.

  **N_sensors**: Number of sensors used to measure parameters that influence the sample, such as temperature or pressure.

  **N_measurements**: Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.

  **N_detection_angles**: Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the sample.

  **N_incident_angles**: Number of angles of incidence of the incident beam.

  **N_observables**: Number of observables that are saved in a measurement. e.g. one for intensity, reflectivity or transmittance, two for Psi and Delta etc. This is equal to the second dimension of the data array 'measured_data' and the number of column names.

                  Vector containing the values of the varied parameter. Its
                  length is equal to N_measurements. The order of the values
                  should be as follows:

                  * Order the sensors according to number_of_parameters starting
                    with the lowest number. If number_of_parameters is equal for
                    two sensors order them alphabetically (sensor/parameter name).
                  * The first sensor's j parameters should be ordered in the
                    following way. The first N_measurements/number_of_parameters
                    entries of the vector contain the first parameter (a1), the
                    second N_measurements/number_of_parameters contain the second
                    parameter (a2) etc., so the vector looks like:
                    [
                    a1,a1,...,a1,
                    a2,a2,...,a2,
                    ...
                    aj,aj,...aj
                    ]
                  * The kth sensor's m parameters should be ordered in the
                    following way:
                    [
                    p1,...p1,p2,...,p2,...pm,...,pm,
                    p1,...p1,p2,...,p2,...pm,...,pm,

                    p1,...p1,p2,...,p2,...pm,...,pm
                    ]
                  * The last sensor's n parameters should be ordered in the
                    following way:
                    [
                    z1,z2,...,zn,

                    ...
                    z1,z2,...,zn]

                  For example, if the experiment was performed at three different
                  temperatures (T1, T2, T3), two different pressures (p1, p2) and
                  two different angles of incidence (a1, a2), then
                  N_measurements = 12 and the order of the values for the various
                  parameter vectors is:

                  * angle_of_incidence: [a1,a1,a1,a1,a1,a1,a2,a2,a2,a2,a2,a2]
                  * pressure: [p1,p1,p1,p2,p2,p2,p1,p1,p1,p2,p2,p2]

              For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
              etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
              direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
              window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
              windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
              use a second 'WINDOW(MXaperture)' field.

              The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
              measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
              a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
              in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
              performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference data should be
              considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
              should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.

              The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
              beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
