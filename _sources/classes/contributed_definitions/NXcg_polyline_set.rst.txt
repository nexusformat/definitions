**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of polylines in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of polylines in Euclidean space.

      Each polyline is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
      Each polyline must have a start and an end point.
      The sequence describes the positive traversal along the polyline when walking
      from the start vertex to the end/last vertex.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 1.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polylines.

  **n_v**: The number of vertices, supporting the polylines.

  **n_total**: The total number of vertices traversed when visiting every polyline.

        The total number of vertices, irrespective of their eventual uniqueness,
        i.e. the total number of vertices that have to be visited when walking
        along each polyline.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/number_of_vertices-field:

    .. collapse:: Array which specifies of how many vertices each polyline is built. ...

        Array which specifies of how many vertices each polyline is built.
        The number of vertices represent the total number of vertices for
        each polyline, irrespectively whether vertices are shared or not.
        See the docstring for polylines for further details about how
        a set with different polyline members should be stored.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/identifier_offset-field:

  .. index:: identifier_offset (field)

  **identifier_offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing ...

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        polylines. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/identifier-field:

  .. index:: identifier (field)

  **identifier**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    Integer used to distinguish polylines for explicit indexing.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/vertices-field:

  .. index:: vertices (field)

  **vertices**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [n_v, d]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    .. collapse:: Positions of the vertices which support the members of the polyline set. ...

        Positions of the vertices which support the members of the polyline set.

        Users are encouraged to reduce the vertices to unique set of positions
        and vertices as this supports a more efficient storage of the geometry data.
        It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively in which
        case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
        Naively here means that one for example stores each vertex of a triangle
        mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
        the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/vertices_are_unique-field:

  .. index:: vertices_are_unique (field)

  **vertices_are_unique**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` 

    .. collapse:: If true indicates that the vertices are all placed at different ...

        If true indicates that the vertices are all placed at different
        positions and have different identifiers, i.e. no points overlap
        or are counted twice.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/polylines-field:

  .. index:: polylines (field)

  **polylines**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_total]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Sequence of vertex identifiers which describe each polyline. ...

        Sequence of vertex identifiers which describe each polyline.

        A trivial example is a set with two polylines with three vertices each.
        If the polylines meet in a junction, say the second vertex is shared
        and marking the junction between the two polylines, it is possible that
        there are only five unique positions suggesting five unique vertices.

        A non-trivial example is a set with several polylines, each of which with
        eventually different number of vertices. The array stores the vertex
        identifiers in the order how the polylines are visited:

        The first entry is the identifier of the start vertex of the first polyline,
        followed by the second vertex of the first polyline, until the last vertex
        of the polyline. Thereafter, the start vertex of the second polyline, and
        so on and so forth. Using the (cumulated) counts in number_of_vertices,
        the vertices of the n-th polyline can be accessed on the following 
        array index interval:
        :math:`[\sum_{i=0}^{i=N-1}, \sum_{i=0}^{i=N}]`.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/length-field:

  .. index:: length (field)

  **length**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

  .. index:: is_closed (field)

  **is_closed**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) 

    .. collapse:: If true specifies that a polyline is closed, i.e. ...

        If true specifies that a polyline is closed, i.e.
        its end point is connected to the start point.

  .. _/NXcg_polyline_set/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations` 

    .. collapse:: Reference to or definition of a coordinate system with ...

        Reference to or definition of a coordinate system with
        which the qualifiers and polyline data are interpretable.
