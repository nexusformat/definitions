      Base class to describe a microstructure, its structural aspects, associated descriptors, properties.

      Whether one uses a continuum or atomic scale description of materials, these are always a model only of
      the true internal structure of a material. Such models are useful as they enable a coarse-graining and
      categorizing of properties and representational aspects from which measured or simulated descriptions
      can be correlated with properties, i.e. descriptor values. The base class here can be used to describe
      the structural aspect of a region-of-interest for a specimen that was investigated or a computer
      simulation that was performed for a virtual specimen.

      Specimens experience thermo-chemo-mechanical processing (steps) before characterization. Therefore,
      the characterized microstructure may not turn out to be the same structure as of the untreated
      sample from which the region-of-interests on the specimen were sampled.

      Fields such as time and increment enable a quantification of the spatiotemporal evolution of a materials'
      structure by using multiple instances of NXmicrostructure. Both measurements and simulation virtually
      always sample this evolution. Most microscopy techniques characterize only a two-dimensional representation
      (projection) of the characterized material volume. Often materials are characterized only for specific states
      or via sampling coarsely in time relative to the timescale at which the physical phenomena take place.
      This is typically a compromise between the research questions and technical surplus practical limitations.

      The term microstructural feature covers here crystals and all sorts of crystal defects within the material
      (interfaces, triple junctions, dislocations, pores, etc.).
      A key challenge with the description of representations and properties of such microstructural features is that
      they can be represented and view as features with different dimensionality. Furthermore, combinations of features of
      different dimensionality are frequently expected to be documented with intuitive naming conventions when
      flat property lists are used. For these key-value dictionaries often folksonomies are used. These can be based
      on ad hoc documentation of such dictionaries in the literature and the metadata section of public data repositories.

      NXmicrostructure is an attempt to standardize these descriptions stronger.

      For crystals the number of typically used technical terms are smaller than for interfaces or line like defects and
      junctions of different types of crystal defects. The term grain describes a contiguous region of material that is
      delineated by interfaces (phase or grain boundaries). With its origin motivated by light optical microscopy though
      a grain is not necessarily a single crystal but can have an internal structure of defect such as dislocations.
      In this base class we use the term and respective group crystals though for single crystals and grains.
      The reason why this is possible is that when e.g. materials engineers talk about grains they inherently assume
      that the internal structure of these grains can be described with homogenized effective properties.
      If alternatively the individual structural crystalline or features of this grain should be distinguished
      it is useful to instantiate these as individual instances of crystals.

      Grain boundaries and phase boundaries are two main categories of interfaces.
      A grain boundary delineates two regions with similar crystal structure and phase but different orientation.
      A grain boundary is thus a homophase interface. By contrast, a heterophase boundary delineates two regions with typically
      but not necessarily dissimilar crystal structure but a different atomic occupation that justifies to distinguish two
      phases. There is a substantial variety of interfaces whose distinction was classically based on geometrical arguments
      but considers that atomic segregation is an equally important structural aspect to consider when classifying grain
      boundaries. A concise overview on theoretical aspect of and the semantics for characterizing interfaces and their properties
      is provided in e.g. `W. Bollmann <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-49173-3>`_ and A. Sutton and R. W. Baluffi,
      Interfaces in Crystalline Materials, Clarendon Press, ISBN 9780198500612.

      Also for junctions between crystal defects there is a considerable variety of terms. Junctions are features in
      three-dimensional Euclidean space even if they are formed maybe only through a monolayer or a pearl chain of atoms.
      Either way their local atomic and electronic environment is different compared to the situation of an ideal crystal,
      or the adjoining defects, which gives typically rise to a plethora of configurations of which some yield useful material
      properties or affect material properties.

      Like crystals and interfaces, junctions are assumed to represent groups of atoms that have specific descriptor values
      which are different to other features. Taking an example, a triple junction is practically a three-dimensional defect as its atoms
      are arranged in three-dimensional space but the characteristics of that defect can often be reduced to a lower-dimensional
      description such as a triple line or a triple point as the projection of a line. Therefore, different representations can
      be used to describe the location, shape, and structure of such defect.

      This base class provides definitions for crystals, grains, interfaces, triple junctions, and quadruple junctions thus covering,
      volumetric, patch, line, and point like features that can serve as examples for future extension.

      As different types of crystal defects can interact, there is a substantial number of in principle characterizable and representable
      objects. Take again a triple line as an example. It is a tubular feature built from three adjoining interfaces. However, dislocations
      as line defects can interact with triple lines. Therefore, one can also argue that along a triple line there exist dislocation-line-
      triple-line junctions, likewise dislocations form own junctions.

      The description took inspiration from `E. E. Underwood <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.1972.tb03709.x>`_
      and E. E. Underwood's book on Quantitative Stereology published in 1970 to categorize features based on their dimensionality.

      Indices can be defined either implicitly or explicitly. Indices for implicit indexing are defined
      on the interval :math:`[index\_offset, index\_offset + cardinality - 1]`. Indices can be used as identifiers
      for distinguishing instances, i.e. indices are equivalent to instance names of individual crystals.

        the materials engineering community.

        Typically, crystals are measured on the surface of a sample via optical or electron microscopy.
        Using X-ray diffraction methods crystals can be observed in bulk specimens.

        Crystals are represented by a set of pixel, voxel, or polygons and their polyline boundaries.

        One- or two-dimensional projections or three-dimensional representation of interfaces
        between crystals as topological entities equivalent to dual_junctions.

        An example for a surface defect. Most important are interfaces such as grain and phase boundaries
        but factually interfaces also exist between the environment and crystals exposed at the
        surface of the specimen or internal surfaces like between crystals, cracks, or pores.

        Interfaces are typically reported as discretized features. For interface projections on the 2D plane
        these are most frequently polyline segments. For interface patches in 3D these are most frequently
        triangulations. Descriptions with continuous functions are seldom used unless simplified configurations
        are studied in modeling and theoretical studies.

        When using discretizations the individual interface segments need to be distinguished from the interfaces
        themselves. Consequently, there are two sets of indices.

          Interfaces can be the physical three-dimensional surfaces or two- or one-dimensional
          projections. The latter situation applies typically for characterization with electron
          microscopy.

          In the case of a two-dimensional projection interfaces are interface traces. These have
          two terminating junctions. In three dimensions though the interface is a surface patch
          that is bounded by multiple triple lines.
