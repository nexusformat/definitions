**Structure**:

  .. _/NXapm/ENTRY-group:

  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY@version-attribute:

    .. index:: version (group attribute)

    **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the file
      that specifies the application definition.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition-field:

    .. index:: definition (field)

    **definition**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      NeXus NXDL schema to which this file conforms.

      Obligatory value: ``NXapm``

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_identifier-field:

    .. index:: experiment_identifier (field)

    **experiment_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier 
      for referring to this experiment.

      The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
      or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link 
      experiments to e.g. proposals.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_description-field:

    .. index:: experiment_description (field)

    **experiment_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Free-text description about the experiment.

      Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
      respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
      of this application definition rather than write details about the
      experiment into this free-text description field.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the microscope session started.
      If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
      application definition should only be used for specifying when the
      experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
      - this start time field should be used.

      Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
      both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
      and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
      even with having both time instances specified, it may not be possible
      to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data 
      were acquired.

      More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
      collected to compute this. These computations can take advantage of
      individual time stamps in NXevent_em instances to provide
      additional pieces of information.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included
      when the microscope session ended.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program-field:

    .. index:: program (field)

    **program**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
      to create the file. Atom probe microscopy experiments are nowadays
      in most cases controlled via commercial software. These are often
      designed as integrated acquisition and instrument control software
      solutions.
      For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the
      least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored
      in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary and the
      specifications of which are not publicly documented.

      Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected
      to the instrument control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary
      binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software
      other than of AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite). In effect, RHIT and HITS files
      store the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless
      for users unless they have access to the commercial software.

      To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy with LEAP instruments 
      delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
      position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
      analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
      necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
      the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
      processing steps have to be stored.

      With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
      (on the detector), calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
      quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
      ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.

      In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
      and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. In turn, these
      labels decode elemental identities and can often also be used to
      resolve isotopes. All these steps are in most cases performed using
      commercial software.

      Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
      (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
      not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
      for the early data acquisition and processing stages to obtain a useful
      reconstructed and ranged dataset.

      Therefore, the application definition documents not only the measurement
      but also the key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary
      data into a tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of an
        ever persistent resource where the source code of the program and
        build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured
        in such a manner that the result file is ideally recreatable
        yielding the same results.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/run_number-field:

    .. index:: run_number (field)

    **run_number**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Not the specimen name or the experiment identifier but the identifier
      through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
      For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/AP Suite
      run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
      Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments in Rouen, use the
      identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.

      As a destructive microscopy method, a run can be performed only once.
      It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
      while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
      needs to be distinguished with 
      different run numbers. We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operation_mode-field:

    .. index:: operation_mode (field)

    **operation_mode**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      What type of atom probe microscope experiment is performed.
      This field can be used e.g. by materials database systems to
      qualitatively filter experiments.
      APT are experiments where the analysis_chamber has no imaging gas.
      For FIM analyses an imaging gas is used, which should be specified
      with the atmosphere in the analysis_chamber group.
      Combinations of the two imaging modes are possible. For these apt_fim
      or other operation_mode the user should specify details in the
      experiment_documentation field.

      Any of these values: ``apt`` | ``fim`` | ``apt_fim`` | ``other``

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_documentation-group:

    **experiment_documentation**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote`

      Binary container for a file or a compressed collection of files which 
      can be used to add further descriptions and details to the experiment.
      The container can hold a compressed archive.

      Required for operation_mode apt_fim or other to give further details.
      Users should not abuse this field to provide free-text information.
      Instead, these should be mapped to respective groups and sections.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/thumbnail-group:

    **thumbnail**: (recommended) :ref:`NXnote`

      A small image that is representative of the entry; this can be an
      image taken from the dataset like a thumbnail of a spectrum.
      A 640 x 480 pixel jpeg image is recommended. 
      Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but not required
      as the main purpose of the thumbnail is to provide e.g. thumbnail
      images for displaying them in data repositories.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/thumbnail@type-attribute:

      .. index:: type (group attribute)

      **@type**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator-group:

    **operator**: (required) :ref:`NXuser`

      Contact information and eventually details of at least one person
      involved in the taking of the microscope session. This can be the
      principle investigator who performed this experiment.
      Adding multiple users if relevant is recommended.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/name-field:

      .. index:: name (field)

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Name of the affiliation of the user at the point in time when the experiment was
        performed.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/address-field:

      .. index:: address (field)

      **address**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Postal address of the affiliation.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/email-field:

      .. index:: email (field)

      **email**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Email address of the user at the point in time when the experiment was
        performed. Writing the most permanently used email is recommended.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/orcid-field:

      .. index:: orcid (field)

      **orcid**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Globally unique identifier of the user as offered by services like ORCID or
        ResearcherID.

        (Business) (tele)phone number of the user at the point in time when the
        experiment was performed.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/role-field:

      .. index:: role (field)

      **role**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Which role does the user have in the place and at the point 
        in time when the experiment was performed? Technician operating
        the microscope. Student, postdoc, principle investigator, guest
        are common examples.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operator/social_media_name-field:

      .. index:: social_media_name (field)

      **social_media_name**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      **social_media_platform**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Name of the social media platform where the account under social_media_name is
        registered.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen-group:

    **specimen**: (required) :ref:`NXsample`


      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/name-field:

      .. index:: name (field)

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Descriptive name or ideally (globally) unique persistent identifier.
        The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially the
        predecessor/origin from where the specimen was cut.
        In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from
        samples or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple
        specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to resolve
        which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken.

        The user is advised to store the details how specimens were 
        cut/prepared from samples in the sample history.
        This field must not be used for an alias of the specimen.
        Instead, use short_title.

        In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
        the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
        by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
        the characterization of a single specimen.

        Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the 
        sample history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/sample_history-field:

      .. index:: sample_history (field)

      **sample_history**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally, a reference to the location of or a (globally) unique
        persistent identifier of e.g. another file which should document 
        ideally as many details as possible of the material, its 
        microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/preparation
        history.

        In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
        available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a
        sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider
        being the key steps and relevant information about the specimen,
        its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing
        state and details of the preparation.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/preparation_date-field:

      .. index:: preparation_date (field)

      **preparation_date**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
        when the specimen was prepared.

        Ideally report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
        the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this
        should be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined
        handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
        the session starts.

        Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
        especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
        hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
        short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
        better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/short_title-field:

      .. index:: short_title (field)

      **short_title**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Possibility to give an abbreviation of the specimen name field.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/atom_types-field:

      .. index:: atom_types (field)

      **atom_types**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Use Hill's system for listing elements of the periodic table which
        are inside or attached to the surface of the specimen and thus
        relevant from a scientific point of view.

        The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an
        opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
        these from the sample history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/description-field:

      .. index:: description (field)

      **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Discouraged free-text field in case properly designed records for the
        sample_history are not available.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (required) :ref:`NXdata`

      Hard link to a location in the hierarchy of the NeXus file
      where the data for default plotting are stored.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET-group:

    **COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET**: (required) :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`

      Container to hold different coordinate systems conventions.

      For the specific idea and conventions to use with the
      NXcoordinate_system_set inspect the description of the
      NXcoordinate_system_set base class.

      Specific details for application in atom probe microscopy follow.
      In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
      Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):

      * The laboratory space;  
        a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
        a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
        transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
        pushes into the instrument.  
      * The specimen space;  
        a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
        whose z axis points towards the detector.  
      * The detector space;  
        a CS affixed whose xy plane is usually in the detector and whose  
        z axis points towards the specimen.  
      * The reconstruction space;  
        a CS associated with the tomographic reconstruction.  
        Its orientation depends on the commercial software used.  
      * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
        flight path of individual ions might be defined.

      Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
      Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.

      In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
      space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
      (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
      within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
      ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.

      For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
      is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
      the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.

      The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
      the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.
      Consult the work of A. J. Breen and B. Gault and team
      for further details.

    **MONITOR**: (optional) :ref:`NXmonitor`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe-group:

    **atom_probe**: (required) :ref:`NXinstrument`

      Metadata and numerical data of the atom probe and the lab in which it 
      stands.

      An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
      scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:

      * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
        (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
        and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
        microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
        and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
        Hence, there is no real probe/beam.  
      * Second, the specimen is the lens of an atom probe microscope.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/control_software-group:

      **control_software**: (optional) :ref:`NXcollection`

        The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
        single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) <https://www.atomprobe.com>`_.
        Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
        instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).

        By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
        research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
        the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
        the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
        the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
        or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
        Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
        to control the instrument.

        Some of which are modularized and open,
        some of which realize also integrated control units with
        portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
        (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.

        Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
        community-specific API for getting finely granularized
        access to such control settings.

        These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
        application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.
        groups to begin with. Holding heterogeneous, not yet standardized
        but relevant pieces of information is the purpose of this collection.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/specimen_monitoring-group:

      **specimen_monitoring**: (optional) :ref:`NXcollection`

        A place where details about the initial shape of the specimen
        can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution
        of the specimen can be stored. There are currently very few
        techniques which can measure the shape evolution:

        * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
          but this usually takes an interrupted experiment  
          in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken,  
          and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
          Examples are `I. Mouton et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161>`_ and `C. Fletcher <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6>`_.
        * Another, less accurate method, though, is to monitor  
          the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
          (if available) in the instrument.  
        * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
          methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_.  
        * A continuous monitoring of the specimen in a   
          correlative electron microscopy/atom probe experiment  
          is planned to be developed by `T. Kelly et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205>`_

          This is a measure of the specimen taper. Define it in such a way
          that the base of the specimen is modelled as a conical frustrum so
          that the shank angle is the (shortest) angle between the specimen

        takes place partly in the control unit of the detector partly
        in the software. The process is controlled by the acquisition/
        instrument control software (IVAS/APSuite/DAVis).
        The exact details are not documented by AMETEK in an open manner.
        For instruments built by individual research groups,
        like the Oxcart instrument, individual timing data from the
        delay-line detector are openly accessible.

        Data post-processing step which is, like the impact position analyses, 
        also usually executed in the integrated control software. 
        This processing yields how many ions were detected with each pulse.

        It is possible that multiple ions evaporate and hit the same or 
        different pixels of the detector on the same pulse. 
        These data form the basis to analyses of the so-called
        (hit) multiplicity of an ion. 
        Multiplicity must not be confused with how many 
        atoms of the same element or isotope, respectively,
        a molecular ion contains (which is encoded with the
        isotope_vector field of each NXion instance.

          The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction 
          is qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers
          or research groups.

          Specific differences exists though in the form of different
          calibration models. For now we do not wish to resolve or 
          generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection
          is to provide a container where model-specific parameters
          and calibration models can be stored if users know these
          for sure.

          For AMETEK LEAP atom probes this should be the place for
          storing initial calibration values. These values are
          accessible normally only by AMETEK service engineers.
          They use these for calibrating the detector and instrument.

          Users can also use this NXcollection for storing the
          iteratively identified calibrations which scientists
          will get displayed in e.g. AP Suite while they execute
          the voltage-and-bowl correction as a part of the
