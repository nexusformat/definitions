**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Application definition for atom probe and field ion microscopy experiments. ...

      Application definition for atom probe and field ion microscopy experiments.

      This application definition provides a place to document data and metadata to
      an atom probe experiment. Primarily the measurement itself is documented.
      However, as most atom probe experiments are controlled with commercial software
      which does not allow to access the raw detector hits, this application definition
      also includes two key groups of processing steps (reconstruction and ranging).

      During tomographic reconstruction measured data are processed into a point cloud
      of reconstructed positions of certain ions. During ranging time-of-flight data
      are identified as representing specific ions to annotate each ion with a label.

      Commercial software used in atom probe research is designed as an integrated
      acquisition and instrument control software. For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode
      atom probe (LEAP) instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results
      and metadata are stored in so-called STR, RRAW, RHIT, and HITS files, which
      are proprietary and their file format specifications not publicly documented.

      Supplementary metadata are kept in a database (formerly known as the ISDb)
      which is connected to the instrument control software and synced with the
      experiment while ions are detected. In effect, RHIT and HITS files
      store the (rawest) experiment data in a closed manner that is
      practically useless for users unless they have access to the
      commercial software.

      To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy (APM) with LEAP instruments
      delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
      position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
      analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
      necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
      the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
      processing steps have to be stored.

      With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
      (on the detector) and calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
      quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
      ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.

      In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
      and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. This is post-processing
      even though in practice it is performed sometimes already (as preview)
      already while data are still being collected.

      The ion types decode molecular identities which can very often be
      mapped to elemental identities, and also be used to distinguish isotopes.
      All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software.

      Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
      (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
      not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
      for the early stage of data acquisition and processing stages to obtain
      a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset.

      This application definition documents not only the measurement but also the
      key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary data into a
      tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.

      Future guidance by the technology partners like AMETEK/Cameca could improve
      this description to cover a substantial larger number of eventually metadata
      that so far are neither publicly documented nor accessible.

          Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier
          for referring to this experiment.

          The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
          or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
          experiments to e.g. proposals.

          Free-text description about the experiment.

          Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
          respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
          of the application definition behind instead of filling in these
          details into the experiment_description free-text description field.

          Users are encouraged to add in this field eventual DOIs to papers
          which yield further details to the experiment.

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` :ref:`⤆ </NXentry/start_time-field>`

          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          included when the microscope session started.
          If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
          application definition should only be used for specifying when the
          experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
          - this start_time field should be used.

          Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
          both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
          and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
          even with having both dates specified, it may not be possible
          to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
          were collected.

          More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
          collected to compute this event chain during the experiment.

          Neither the specimen_name nor the experiment_identifier but the identifier
          through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
          For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/APSuite
          run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
          Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the
          identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.
          The field does not have to be required if the information is recoverable
          in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case when RHIT or HITS
          files are also stored alongside a data artifact instance which is
          generated according to this NXapm application definition.

          As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
          It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
          while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
          needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
          We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.

          This application definition does currently not allow storing the
          entire set of such interrupted runs. Not because of a technical limitation
          within NeXus but because we have not seen a covering use case based
          on which we could have designed and implemented this case. 
          Atom probers are invited to contact the respective people in the
          FAIRmat team to fix this.

          What type of atom probe microscopy experiment is performed.
          This field is primarily meant to inform materials database systems
          to qualitatively filter experiments:

          * apt are experiments where the analysis_chamber has no imaging gas.  
            experiment with LEAP instruments are typically performed as apt.  
          * fim are experiments where the analysis_chamber has an imaging gas,  
            which should be specified with the atmosphere in the analysis_chamber group.  
          * apt_fim should be used for combinations of the two imaging modes.  
          * other should be used in combination with the user specifying details in the  
            experiment_documentation field.

          Any of these values: ``apt`` | ``fim`` | ``apt_fim`` | ``other``

          Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but not required

          Description of the sample from which the specimen was prepared or
          site-specifically cut out using e.g. a focused-ion beam instrument.

          The sample group is currently a place for storing suggestions from
          atom probers about other knowledge they have gained about the sample
          from which they cut the specimen which is field-evaporated during the
          experiment. Typically this is possible because the atom probe specimen
          is usually not heat treated as is but one assumes that one has the sample
          prepared as needed (i.e. with a specific grain diameter) and can thus
          just cut out the specimen from that material.

          There are cases though where the specimen is processed further, i.e. the
          specimen is machined further or exposed to external stimuli during the
          experiment. In this case, these details should not be stored in the
          sample group but atom probers should make suggestions how this application
          definition can be improved to find a better place and compromise
          how to improve this application definition.

          In the future also details like how the grain_diameter was characterized,
          how the sample was prepared, how the material was heat-treated etc.,
          should be stored as using specific application definitions/schemas
          which are then arranged and documented with a description of the workflow
          so that actionable graphs become instantiatable.

            Qualitative information about the grain size, here specifically
            described as the equivalent spherical diameter of an assumed
            average grain size for the crystal ensemble.
            Users of this information should be aware that although the grain
            diameter or radius is often referred to as grain size and used in
            e.g. Hall-Petch-type materials models this is if at all an ensemble
            average whose reporting may be very informative or not if the specimen
            contains a few grains only. In atom probe the latter is often the case
            because grains are measured partially as their diameter can be in the
            order of magnitude of the physical diameter of the specimen.

            Reporting a grain size is useful though as it allows judging if
            specific features are expected to be found in the detector hit map.

            i.e. the first derivative of the measured time-temperature profile
            is itself time-dependant. An example is when the specimen was
            left in the furnace after the furnace was switched off. In this case
            the specimen cools down with a specific rate of how this furnace
            cools down in the lab. Processes which in practice are often not
            documented with measuring the time-temperature profile.

            This can be problematic because when the furnace door was left open
            or the ambient temperature in the lab changes, i.e. for a series of
            experiments where one is conducted on a hot summer
            day and the next during winter as might have an effect on the
            evolution of the microstructure. There are many cases where this
            has been reported to be an issue in industry, e.g. think about aging
            aluminium samples left on the factory parking lot on a hot summer
            day.

              Reporting compositions as atom and weight percent yields both
              dimensionless quantities but their conceptual interpretation
              differs. A normalization based on atom_percent counts relative to the
              total number of atoms are of a particular type. By contrast, weight_percent
              normalization factorizes in the respective mass of the elements.
              Python libraries like pint are challenged by these differences as
              at.-% and wt.-% both yield fractional quantities.

            Descriptive name or ideally (globally) unique persistent identifier.
            The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially the
            predecessor/origin (see the sample group) from where this specimen was cut.
            In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from the
            sample referred to in the sample group or in cases of an instrument session
            during which multiple specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive
            enough to resolve which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken.

            The user is advised to store the details how a specimen was cut/prepared
            from a specific sample in the sample_history. The sample_history field 
            must not be used for writing an alias of the specimen. Instead,
            use the field alias for this. As an example there may be a specimen/sample
            monitoring system in a lab with bar codes. The bar code is a good
            specimen/sample name. A shorter and more human readable alias like
            A0 can be an example for something to write in the alias field.

            In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
            the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
            by this NXentry, because a single NXentry is to be used for the 
            characterization of a single specimen in a single continuous run.

            Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
            sample_history or if this is not possible in the sample group.

            microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/
            preparation history.

            In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
            available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a
            sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider
            as being the key steps and relevant information about the specimen,
            its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing
            state and details of the preparation.

            ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
            when the specimen was prepared.

            Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
            the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this
            should be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined
            handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
            the session starts.

            Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
            especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
            hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
            short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
            better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

          Container to hold different coordinate systems conventions.

          For the specific idea and conventions to use with the
          NXcoordinate_system_set inspect the description of the
          NXcoordinate_system_set base class. Specific details for application
          in atom probe microscopy follow.

          In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
          Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):

          * World space;  
            a CS specifying a local coordinate system of the planet earth which
            identifies into which direction gravity is pointing such that
            the laboratory space CS can be rotated into this world CS.
          * The laboratory space;  
            a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
            a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
            transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
            has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.  
            In summary, this CS is defined by the chassis of the instrument.
          * The specimen space;  
            a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
            whose z axis points towards the detector.  
          * The detector space;  
            a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the  
            detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.  
            This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion  
            positions.  
          * The reconstruction space;  
            a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.  
            The orientation depends on the analysis software used.  
          * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
            flight path of individual ions might be defined.

          Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
          Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.

          In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
          space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
          (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
          within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
          ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.

          For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
          is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
          the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.

          The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
          the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.
          Consult the work of A. J. Breen and B. Gault and team
          for further details.

          An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
          scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:

          * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
            (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
            and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
            microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
            and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
            Hence, there is no real probe/beam.  
          * Second, the specimen is the lens of the microscope.

            A place where details about the initial shape of the specimen
            can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution
            of the specimen can be stored. There are currently very few
            techniques which can measure the shape evolution:

            * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
              but this usually takes an interrupted experiment  
              in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken,  
              and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
              Examples are `I. Mouton et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161>`_  
              and `C. Fletcher <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6>`_.  
            * Another method, which is less accurate though, is to monitor  
              the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
              (if available) in the instrument.  
            * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
              methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_.  
            * A continuous monitoring of the specimen in a   
              correlative electron microscopy/atom probe experiment  
              is planned to be developed by `T. Kelly et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205>`_  
              Nothing can be said about the outcome of this research yet but  
              here is where such spatio-temporally data could be stored.

            The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
            single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) <https://www.atomprobe.com>`_.
            Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
            instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).

            By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
            research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
            the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
            the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
            the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
            or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
            Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
            to control the instrument.

            Some of which are modularized and open,
            some of which realize also integrated control units with
            portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
            (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.

            Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
            community-specific API for getting finely granularized
            access to such control settings.

            These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
            application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.
            groups to begin with. Holding heterogeneous, not yet standardized
            but relevant pieces of information is the purpose of this collection.

              or research groups.

              Specific differences exists though in the form of different
              calibration models. For now we do not wish to resolve or
              generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection
              is to provide a container where model-specific parameters
              and calibration models can be stored if users know these
              for sure.

              For AMETEK LEAP instruments this should be the place for
              storing initial calibration values. These values are
              accessible normally only by AMETEK service engineers.
              They use these for calibrating the detector and instrument.

              Users can also use this NXcollection for storing the
              iteratively identified calibrations which scientists
              will see displayed in e.g. APSuite while they execute
