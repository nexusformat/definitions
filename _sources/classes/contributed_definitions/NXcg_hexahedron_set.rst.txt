**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of hexahedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of hexahedra in Euclidean space.

      The hexahedra do not have to be connected, can have different size,
      can intersect, and be rotated.
      This class can also be used to describe cuboids or cubes, axis-aligned or not.
      The class represents different access and description levels to offer both
      applied scientists and computational geometry experts to use the same
      base class but rather their specific view on the data:

      * Most simple many experimentalists wish to communicate dimensions/the size
        of specimens. In this case the alignment with axes is not relevant as
        eventually the only relevant information to convey is the volume of the 
        specimen.
      * In many cases, take for instance an experiment where a specimen was taken
        from a specifically deformed piece of material, e.g. cold-rolled,
        channel-die deformed, the orientation of the specimen edges with the
        experiment coordinate system can be of very high relevance.
        Examples include to know which specimen edge is parallel to the rolling,
        the transverse, or the normal direction.
      * Sufficient to pinpoint the sample and laboratory/experiment coordinate
        system, the above-mentioned descriptions are not detailed enough though
        to create a CAD model of the specimen.
      * Therefore, groups and fields for an additional, computational-geometry-
        based view of the hexahedra is offered which serve different computational
        tasks: storage-oriented simple views or detailed topological/graph-based
        descriptions.

      Hexahedra are important geometrical primitives, which are among the most
      frequently used elements in finite element meshing/modeling.

      Hexahedra have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of polygons
      which are not self-intersecting.

      The term hexahedra will be used throughout this base class but includes
      the especially in engineering and more commonly used special cases,
      cuboid, cube, box, axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), optimal bounding
      box (OBB).

      An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in
      computational science and codes to represent a cuboid whose edges
      are aligned with a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees these
      are important data objects for time as well as space efficient queries
      of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.

      An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best
      tight fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
      rotated. Exact and substantially faster in practice approximate algorithms
      exist for computing optimal or near optimal bounding boxes for point sets.
