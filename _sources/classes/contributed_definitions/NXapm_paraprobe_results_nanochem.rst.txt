              convenience always as large as the entire dataset as it will
              be stored compressed anyway. The convenience feature with this
              is that then the mask can be decoded with numpy and mirrored
              against the evaporation_id array and one immediately can filter
              out all points that were used by the paraprobe-toolbox executable.
              The length of the array adds to the next unsigned integer
              if the number of ions in the dataset is not an integer
              multiple of the bitdepth (padding).

                The weighting model specifies how mark data are mapped to a weight
                per point/ion. For atom probe microscopy (APM) mark data are e.g.
                which iontype an ion has. As an example, different models are used
                which account differently for the multiplicity of a point/ion
                during delocalization:

                * unity, all points/ions get the same weight 1.
                * atomic_decomposition, points get as much weight as they
                  have atoms of a type in atomic_decomposition_rule,

                (intensity) of ions or elements. Alternatively the tool can compute
                the total intensity, the composition, or the concentration of the
                ions/elements specified by the white list of elements in each voxel.

                Any of these values:

                Weighting factor, in atom probe, often termed multiplicity.
                The weighting factor is the multiplier with which the integrated
                intensity contribution from the point/ion gets multiplied.
                The delocalization computes the integrated intensity for each
                grid cell. Effectively, this is an explicitly evaluated kernel
                method where each specific position of an ion is replaced by a
                smoothing kernel. For atom probe weights are positive and integer
                specifically the multiplicity of the ion, in accordance with the
                respective rulesets as defined by weighting_model.

                Elements must exist in the periodic table of elements and be

                Values in match are isotope hash values using the following
                hashing rule $H = Z + 256*N$ with $Z$ the number of protons
                and $N$ the number of neutrons of the isotope.
                In the case of elements this hashing rule has the advantage
                that for elements the proton number is their hash value because
                N is zero.

                An iso-surface is the boundary between two regions across which
                the magnitude of a scalar field falls below/exceeds a threshold
                magnitude phi.
                For applications in atom probe microscopy the location and shape
                of such a boundary (set) is typically approximated by
                discretization.
                This yields a complex of not necessarily connected geometric
                primitives. Paraprobe-nanochem approximates this complex with
                a soup of triangles.

                      and vertices as this supports a more efficient storage of the geometry data.

                      case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
                      Naively here means that one for example stores each vertex of a triangle
                      mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
                      the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.

                    Iso-surfaces of arbitrary scalar three-dimensional fields
                    can show a complicated topology. Paraprobe-nanochem can run
                    a DBScan-like clustering algorithm which performs a
                    connectivity analysis on the triangle soup. This yields a
                    set of connected features with their surfaces discretized
                    by triangles. Currently, the tool distinguishes at most
                    three types of features:

                    1. So-called objects, i.e. necessarily watertight features
                       represented polyhedra.
                    2. So-called proxies, i.e. features that were replaced by a
                       proxy mesh and made watertight.
                    3. Remaining triangle surface meshes of arbitrary shape and
                       cardinality.

                    These features can be interpreted as microstructural features.
                    Some of them may be precipitates, some of them may be poles,
                    some of them may be segments of dislocation lines or other
                    crystal defects which are decorated (or not) with solutes.
