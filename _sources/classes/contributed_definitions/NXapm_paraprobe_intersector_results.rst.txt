        .. collapse:: During coprecipitation analysis the current and next set are analyzed ...

            During coprecipitation analysis the current and next set are analyzed
            for links in a special way. Three set comparisons are made. Members
            of the set in each comparison are analyzed for overlap and proximity:

            The first comparison is the current_set against the current_set.
            The second comparison is the next_set against the next_set.
            The third comparison is the current_set against the next_set.

            Once the (forward) links for these comparisons are ready, pair relations
            are analyzed with respect to which objects with indices_feature
            cluster in identifier space. Thereby, a logical connection (link) is
            established between the features in the current_set and the next_set.
            Recall that these two sets typically represent different features
            within an observed system for otherwise the same parameterization.

            Examples include two sets of e.g. precipitates with differing
            chemical composition that were characterized in the same material
            volume representing a snapshot of an e.g. microstructure at the same
            point in time. Researchers may have performed two analyses, one to
            characterize precipitates A and another one for precipitates B.

            Coprecipitation analysis now logically connects these independent
            characterization results to establish spatial correlations of e.g.
            the precipitates' spatial arrangement.
