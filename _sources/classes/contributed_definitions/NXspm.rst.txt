      Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is a branch of microscopy that utilizes a physical probe to scan the surface of
      sample and image it at the atomic level.

      The application class NXspm is designed as a skeleton and contains common technical concepts
      for specific SPM sub-techniques such as STM, STS, AFM etc. In addition, it can be utilized to
      describe the SPM experiments without further specialization for each sub-technique.
