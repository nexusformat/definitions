  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms in Euclidean space ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms in Euclidean space.

      The parallelograms do not have to be connected, can have different size,
      can intersect, and be rotated.
      This class can also be used to describe rectangles or squares, axis-aligned or not.
      The class represents different access and description levels to offer both
      applied scientists and computational geometry experts to use the same
      base class but rather their specific view on the data:

      * Most simple many experimentalists wish to communicate dimensions/the size
        of e.g. a region of interest in the 2D plane. In this case the alignment
        with axes is not relevant as eventually relevant is only the area of the ROI.
      * In other cases the extent of the parallelogram is relevant though.
      * Finally in CAD models we would like to specify the polygon
        which is parallelogram represents.

      Parallelograms are important geometrical primitives. Not so much because of their
      uses in nowadays, thanks to improvements in computing power, not so frequently
      any longer performed 2D simulation. Many scanning experiments probe though
      parallelogram-shaped ROIs on the surface of samples.

      Parallelograms have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of polygons
      which are not self-intersecting.

      The term parallelogram will be used throughout this base class but includes
      the especially in engineering and more commonly used special cases,
      rectangle, square, 2D box, axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), or
      optimal bounding box (OBB) but here the analogous 2D cases.

      An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in computational science
      and codes to represent a rectangle whose edges are aligned with the axes 
      of a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees these are important data
      objects for time- as well as space-efficient queries
      of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.

      An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best
      tight fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
      rotated. Other than in 3D dimensions the rotation calipher method offers
      a rigorous approach to compute optimal bounding boxes in 2D.

        an axis of the coordinate system.

        a specific coordinate system.

        whether parallelograms are rectangles/squares whose primary edges
        are parallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        parallelograms. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
