          .. collapse:: During coprecipitation analysis the current and next set are analyzed ...

              During coprecipitation analysis the current and next set are analyzed
              for links in a special way. Three set comparisons are made. Members
              of the set in each comparison are analyzed for overlap and proximity:

              The first comparison is the current_set against the current_set.
              The second comparison is the next_set against the next_set.
              The third comparison is the current_set against the next_set.

              Once the (forward) links for these comparisons are ready the
              pair relations are analyzed with respect to which feature identifier
              cluster in identifier space. Thereby a logical connection (link) is
              established between the features in the current_set and next_set.
              Recall that these two set typically represent different features
              within an observed system for otherwise the same parameterization.
              Examples include two sets of e.g. precipitates with differing
              chemical composition that were characterized in the same material
              volume representing a snapshot of an e.g. microstructure at the same
              point in time. Researchers may have performed two analyses, one to
              characterize precipitates A and another one to characterize percipitates
              B. Coprecipitation analysis now logically connects these independent
              characterization results to establish spatial correlations of e.g.
              precipitates spatial arrangement.
