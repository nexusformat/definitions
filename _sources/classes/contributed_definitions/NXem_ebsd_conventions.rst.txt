**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Conventions for rotations and coordinate systems to interpret EBSD data. ...

      Conventions for rotations and coordinate systems to interpret EBSD data.

      This is the main issue which currently is not in all cases documented
      and thus limits the interoperability and value of collected EBSD data.
      Not communicating EBSD data with such contextual pieces of information
      and the use of file formats which do not store this information is the
      key unsolved problem.

          The reference frame for the sample surface reference is used for

          information collected from an electron beam scanning the
          sample surface. We assume the configuration is inspected by
          looking towards the sample surface from a position that is
          located behind the detector.

          The sample surface reference frame has coordinates Xs, Ys, Zs.
          In three dimensions these coordinates are not necessarily
          located on the surface of the sample as there are multiple
          faces/sides of the sample. Most frequently though the coordinate
          system here is used to define the surface which the electron
          beam scans.

          Different tools assume that different strategies can be used
          and are perceived as differently convenient to enter
          details about coordinate system definitions. In this ELN users
          have to possibility to fill in what they assume is sufficient to
          define the coordinate system directions unambiguously.
          Software which works with this user input needs to offer parsing

          Keywords assume the region-of-interest is defined by
          a rectangle. We observe this rectangle and inspect the
          direction of the outer-unit normals to the edges of

      .. collapse:: In which direction are positive values for PCx measured from ...

          In which direction are positive values for PCx measured from
          the specified boundary. Keep in mind that the gnomonic space
          is in virtually all cases embedded in the detector space.
          Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is
          embedded/laying inside the XdYd plane (of the detector
          reference frame).
          When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the
          detector x-axis direction, we state that we effectively
          normalize in fractions of the width of the detector.

          The issue with terms like width and height is that these
          degenerate if the detector region-of-interest is square-shaped.
          This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but
          state how we would measure distances practically with a ruler and
          how we then measure positive distances.
