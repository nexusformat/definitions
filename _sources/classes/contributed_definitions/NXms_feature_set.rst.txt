        If depends_on is set to "." or this attribute is not defined in an instance

        to parent features as are resolvable via depends_on.
        This array enables to compute the array interval from which details for

        described feature set are defined (implicitly from 0, to c-1 or via explicit

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        features. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
