**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of polygons in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of polygons in Euclidean space.

      Polygons are related are specialized polylines:

      * A polygon is a geometric primitive that is bounded by a closed polyline
      * All vertices of this polyline lay in the d-1 dimensional plane.
        whereas vertices of a polyline do not necessarily lay on a plane.
      * A polygon has at least three vertices.

      Each polygon is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
      The members of a set of polygons may have a different number of vertices.
      Sometimes a collection/set of polygons is referred to as a soup of polygons.

      As three-dimensional objects, a set of polygons can be used to define the
      hull of what is effectively a polyhedron; however users are advised to use
      the specific NXcg_polyhedron_set base class if they wish to describe closed
      polyhedra. Even more general complexes can be thought, for instance
      piecewise-linear complexes, as these can have holes though, polyhedra without
      holes are one subclass of such complexes, users should rather design an own
      base class e.g. NXcg_polytope_set to describe such even more
      complex primitives.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be either 2 or 3.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polygons.

  **n_total**: The total number of vertices when visiting every polygon.

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        polygons. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

        Array of interior angles. There are many values per polygon as number_of_vertices.
        The angle is the angle at the specific vertex, i.e. between the adjoining
        edges of the vertex according to the sequence in the polygons array.
        Usually, the winding_order field is required to interpret the value.
