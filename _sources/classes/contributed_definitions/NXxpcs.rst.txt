**Status**:

  *application definition* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) data (results). ...

      X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) data (results).

      The purpose of ``NXxpcs`` is to document and communicate an accepted vernacular for various XPCS results data
      in order to support development of community software tools.  The definition presented here only
      represents a starting point and contains fields that a common software tool should support for
      community acceptance.

      Additional fields may be added to XPCS results file (either formally or informally).  It is expected
      that this XPCS data will be part of multi-modal data set that could involve e.g., :ref:`NXcanSAS` or
      1D and/or 2D data.

**Symbols**:

  The symbol(s) listed here will be used below to coordinate datasets with the same shape.

  **nP**: Number of points

            ..  math:: g_2(\boldsymbol Q,t) = \frac{ \langle I(\boldsymbol Q,t\prime) I(\boldsymbol Q,t\prime + t) \rangle }{ \langle I(\boldsymbol Q,t\prime)\rangle^2 }; t > 0

            Typically, :math:`g_2` is a quantity calculated for a group of pixels representing a specific
            region of reciprocal space.  These groupings, or bins, are generically described as :math:`q`. Some
            open-source XPCS libraries refer to these bins as "rois", which are not to be confused with
            EPICS AreaDetector ROI. See usage guidelines for q_lists and roi_maps within a mask.  [#]_

            In short, :math:`g_2` should be ordered according to the roi_map value.  In principle, any format is acceptable if
            the data and its axes are self-describing as per NeXus recommendations. However, the data is preferred in one
            of the following two formats:

            * iterable list of linked files (or keys) for each :math:`g_2` with 1 file (key) per :math:`q`, where `q` is called by the nth roi_map value
            * 2D array [#]_ with shape (:math:`g_2`, :math:`q`), where `q` is represented by the nth roi_map value, not the value `q` value

            Note it is expected that "g2" and all quantities following it will be of the same length.

            Other formats are acceptable with sufficient axes description.

            This is quantized difference so that the "step" between two consecutive
            frames is one frame (or step ``= dt = 1 frame``)

            It is the "quantized" delay time corresponding to the ``g2`` values.

            The unit of delay_differences is ``NX_INT`` for units of frames (i.e., integers) preferred,
            refer to :ref:`NXdetector` for conversion to time units.

            two-time correlation of speckle intensity for a given q-bin or roi (represented by the nth roi_map value)

            See Fluerasu, Phys Rev E (2007), Eq 1 and Sutton, Optics Express (2003) for an early
            description applied to X-ray scattering:

            .. math:: C(\boldsymbol Q, t_1, t_2) = \frac{ \langle I(\boldsymbol Q, t_1)I(\boldsymbol Q, t_2)\rangle }{ \langle I(\boldsymbol Q,t_1)\rangle \langle I(\boldsymbol Q,t_2)\rangle }

            in which time is quantized by frames. In principle, any data format is acceptable if
            the data and its axes are self-describing as per NeXus recommendations. However, the data is preferred in one
            of the following two formats:

            * iterable list of linked files (or keys) for each q-bin called by the nth roi_map value. data for each bin is a 2D array
            * 3D array with shape (frames, frames, q) or (q, frames, frames), where :math:`q` is represented by the nth roi_map value, not the value `q` value

            The computation of this result can be customized.  These customizations can affect subsequently derived results (below).  The
            following attributes will be used to manage the customization.

            * Other normalization methods may be applied, but the method will not be specified in this
              definition. Some of these normalization methods result in a baseline value of ``0``, not ``1``.

            * The various software libraries use different programming languages.  Therefore, we need to
              specify the ``time = 0`` origin location of the 2D array for each :math:`q`.

            * A method to reduce data storage needs is to only record half of the 2D array by populating
              array elements above or below the array diagonal.

            XPCS data is typically produced by area detector (likely EPICS AreaDetector) as a stack of 2D images. Sometimes
            this data is represented in different ways (sparse arrays or photon event list), but this detail
            is left to the analysis software.  Therefore, we only include requirements based on full array data.

            We note that the image origin (pixel coordinates (0,0)) are found at the top left of a single 2D image array. This
            is the standard expected by Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank. [#]_
            See CXI version 1.6 and Maia, Nature Methods (2012).  This seems to be consistent with matplotlib and
            the practiced implementation of EPICS AreaDetector.  However, some exceptions may exists in the CXI
            documentation (See Fig 11 vs Fig 12).

            Additionally, not all :ref:`NXdetector` dependencies are inherited from AreaDetector or other control systems. ``frame_time`` is used to
            convert ``delay_difference`` to seconds.  ``frame_time`` field could be missing from AreaDetector or may
            either be `acquire_period` or `acquire_time`, depending on the detector model and the local implementation.

            Data masks or mappings to regions of interest (roi) for specific :math:`Q` values

            Fields in this ``masks`` group describe regions of interest
            in the data by either a mask to select pixels or to associate
            a *map* of rois with a (one-dimensional) *list* of values.

            "roi_maps" provide for representation of pixel binning that are arbitrary and irregular,
            which is geometry scattering agnostic and most flexible. The maps work as a labeled array for N rois.

            "Dynamic" represents quantities directly related to XPCS and NXxcps/entry/data and
            NXxpcs/entry/two_time.

            "Static" refers to finer binning used for computation not strictly used for the final
            XPCS results. Implementation of _static_ binning is left for individual libraries to
            document.  We encourage usage of :ref:`NXcanSAS` to represent standard SAXS results or
            development of new NeXus definitions for GI-SAXS or other reciprocal space
            intensity mapping.

          .. collapse:: roi index array or labeled array ...

              roi index array or labeled array

              The values of this mask index (or map to) the :math:`Q` value from the
              the ``dynamic_q_list`` field. Not that the value of ``0`` represents in-action. XPCS computations
              are performed on all pixels with a value > 0.

              The ``units`` attribute should be set to ``"au"``
              indicating arbitrary units.

        .. _/NXxpcs/ENTRY/instrument/masks/dynamic_q_list-field:

        .. index:: dynamic_q_list (field)

          .. collapse:: 1-D list of :math:`Q` values, one for each roi index value. ...

              1-D list of :math:`Q` values, one for each roi index value.

              List order is determined by the index value of the associated roi map starting at ``1``.

              The only requirement for the list is that it may be iterable. Some expected formats are:

              * iterable list of floats (i.e., :math:`Q(r)`)
              * iterable list of tuples (i.e., :math:`Q(r)`, :math:`\varphi`), but preferable use the separate :math:`\varphi` field below
              * iterable list of tuples (e.g., (H, K, L); (qx, qy, qz); (horizontal_pixel, vertical_pixel))
              * iterable list of integers (for Nth roi_map value) or strings

              This format is chosen because results plotting packages are not common and simple I/O is required by end user.
              The lists can be accessed as lists, arrays or via keys

              The values of this mask index the :math:`|Q|` value from the
              the ``static_q_list`` field.

              The ``units`` attribute should be set to ``"au"``
