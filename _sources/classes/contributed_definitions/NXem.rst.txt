**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Characterization of a sample during a session on an electron microscope. ...

      Characterization of a sample during a session on an electron microscope.

      **The idea and aim of NXem**:
      Electron microscopy (EM) research, whether it be performed with scanning electron
      microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM) instruments, uses
      versatile tools for preparing and characterizing samples and specimens.
      The term specimen is considered a synonym for sample in this application definition.
      A specimen is a physical portion of material that is studied/characterized during
      the microscope session, eventually in different places on the specimen surface,
      illuminating the surface layers or shining through thin specimens.
      These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).

      Fundamentally, an electron microscope is an electron accelerator.
      Experimentalists use it in sessions during which they characterize as well as
      prepare specimens. This application definition describes data and metadata about
      processes and characterization tasks applied to one specimen.
      The application definition focuses on the usage of EM in materials research.
      The application definition design makes it in principle applicable also in
      cryo-EM on biomaterials.

      Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple :ref:`NXentry` instances.

      **Electron microscopes motivate the development of a comprehensive data schema:**
      There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
      operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of scientists.
      These users may perform analyses for other users as a service task, especially
      in large research facility settings. Oftentimes, though, and especially for
      cutting-edge instruments, the scientists guide the process and maybe even control
      the microscope. Instruments are usually controlled on-premises but also more
      and more functionalities for remote control have become available.
      Scientists oftentimes can ask technicians for support. In all cases,
      these people are considered users. Users might have different
      roles though.

      The rational behind a common EM schema rather than making separate schemas
      for SEM or TEM are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM
      instruments:

      Both type of instruments have electro-magnetic lenses. These may differ in
      design, alignment, number, and level of corrected for aberrations.
      As an obvious difference, a TEM is mainly used for measuring the transmitted
      electron beam. This calls for using a different lens setup and relative
      placement of the specimen in the lens setup. Also TEM specimens are
      substantially thinner than specimens characterized with SEM to enable an
      illumination through the specimen. This offers capabilities for probing of 
      additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction which are
      unavailable in SEMs.

      Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
      measure different types of signals that originate from the same set of
      radiation/specimen interactions. Often these detectors have a similar design
      and technology or are even used both in SEMs and TEMs.

      **A comprehensive schema instead of specific SEM or TEM schemas**:
      Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
      been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
      communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
      acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower it
      is the addressed circle of users which develops or uses schemas for research
      data management (RDM) with EM, the more understandable it is that scientists
      of either community (or sub-community) ask for designing method-specific schemas.

      Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
      may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
      an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
      Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
      (X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
      what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
      research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
      schemas such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.

      However, the history of electron microscopy has shown that these activities led
      to a zoo of schemas and vocabulary, with implementation in many data and file formats,
      difficult to make interoperable. Instead of trying to maintain this, we would like
      to advocate that the `FAIR principles <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18>`_
      should guide all decisions how data and metadata should be stored.

      EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
      there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different schemas
      with associated representations of data and metadata: Each combination of
      schemas or an interoperable-made handshake between two file formats or software
      packages has to be maintained by software developers. This counts especially
      when data should be processed interoperably between software packages.

      This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
      between tools have to be maintained. This can result in usage of different
      terminology, which in turn results in representations and connections made
      between different data representations and workflows that are not
      machine-actionable.
      `There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology. <https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary>`_

      **The advantage of working towards a common vocabulary and representation**:
      A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemas and
      scientists can reuse for instance these terms, thus supporting interoperability.
      Ideally, scientists specialize an application definition only for the few very
      specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
      better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
      This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
      removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemas.

      Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemas rather than
      a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
      academia and industry as it enables a focusing of software development
      efforts on those schemas, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonizing
      their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
      for technology partners building EM hard- and software as it improves the
      longevity of certain schemas; and thus can help with incentivizing them to support
      the community with implementing support for such schemas into their applications.

      In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
      in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
      interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.

      The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
      (EM-research specific base classes) for defining schemas for EM research.
      Thereby, NXem can be useful to extends top-level ontologies towards a domain-
      and method-specific ontology for electron microscopy as it is used for
      materials research.

      Working towards a common vocabulary is a community activity that profits from
      everybody reflecting in detail whether certain terms they have used in the past
      are not eventually conceptually similar if not the same as what this application
      definition and its base classes provide. We are happy for receiving your feedback.

      **Addressing the generality versus specificity challenge**:
      It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for NeXus), schemas differ
      already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
      but it is set optional in another schema. If group(s), field(s), or
      attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemas can
      become inconsistent. It is noteworthy to mention that the idea of a NeXus application
      definition serves as a contract between a data provider and a data consumer.
      Providers can be the software of a specific microscopes or users with specific
      analysis needs. Consumers can be again specific software tools, like vendor
      software for controlling the instrument or a scientific software for doing
      artificial intelligence analyses on EM data). Such changes of a schema lead
      to new versions.

      **Verification of constraints and conditions**:
      Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against all such possible inconsistencies;
      however NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which schemas can be
      documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
      (at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
      not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable
      and interoperable FAIR data.

      This stresses again the fundamental and necessary role of working towards
      a common vocabulary and, with a longer perspective in mind, a machine-actionable
      knowledge representation and verification engine. So far many conditions and
      requirements are formulated in the docstrings of the respective entries of
      the application definition.

      **NXem takes a key step towards standardization of EM data schemas**.
      It offers a controlled vocabulary and set of relations between concepts and
      enables the description of the data which are collected for research with
      electron microscopes. To be most efficient and offering reusability, the NXem
      application definition should be understood as a template that one should
      ideally use as is. NXem can be considered a base for designing more specialized
      definitions. These should ideally be prefixed with NXem_method (e.g. NXem_ebsd).

      **The use of NXem should be as follows:**
      Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but leave these
      optional or, even better, propose changes to NXem.

      A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
      their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
      corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
      of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
      It is questionable to which level such a reproducibility is possible with EM
      at all considering beam damage, effects of the environment, and other not
      exactly quantifiable influences.
      While this points to the physical limitations there are also practical and
      economical constraints on how completely EM research can be documented:
      For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
      detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
      may not be retrievable as technology partners have a substantiated interest in
      finding a compromise between being open to their users and securing their
      business models.

      By design, EM experiments illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
      consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
      As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
      procedures and system setups should be addressed first.

      If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
      geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
      experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
      hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
      between clarity but being system-agnostic at the same time.
      Settings of apertures are an example where aperture modes are in most cases
      aliases behind which there is a set of very detailed settings specific to the
      software and control units used. These settings are difficult to retrieve,
      are not fully documented by technology partners. This simplification for
      users of microscopes makes experiments easier understandable.
      On the flipside these subtilities limit the opportunities of especially open-
      source developments to make data schemas covering enough for general usage and
      specific enough and sufficiently detailed to remain useful for
      research by electron microscopy domain experts.

      Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
      eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting
      this NXem application definition and base classes is that there are numerous
      (technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
      disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
      nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
      place to hold these nested representations; however as discussed
      at the cost of generality.

      Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
      a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
      if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
      it especially challenging is when the application definition is expected to
      hold all data that might be of relevance for future questions.

      We are skeptical if there is one such representation that can fulfill all these
      aims and interest, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable
      by a large number of scientists in a community. However, we are also convinced
      that this is not a reason to accept the status quo of having a very large set
      of oftentimes strongly overlapping and redundant schemas.

      NXem is our proposal to motivate the EM community to work towards more
      standardization and discussion of what constitutes data, i.e. metadata,
      numerical and categorical data in research with electron microscopes. We found
      that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled vocabulary.

      We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
      SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
      common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.
      Therefore,

      **This application definition has the following components at the top-level:**

      * Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should  
        have an associated time-zone-aware time stamp and report of the specific  
        settings of the microscope at that point in time when the image was taken.  
        This is why instances of :ref:`NXevent_data_em` have their own em_lab section.  
        The reason is that EMs can be highly dynamic, used to illuminate the specimen  
        differently or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.  
        What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement?  
        This can be the collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),  
        taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set of  
        EBSD line scans and/or surface mappings in an SEM, or the ion-beam-milling of a  
        specimen in preparation for e.g. an atom probe experiment.  
      * :ref:`NXmonitor`;
        instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities  
        pertaining to specific components of the instrument.  
        Alternatively, NXevent_data_em instances can be used to store  
        time-zone-aware dates of the components, which is  
        relevant for documenting as exactly as practically possible settings  
        when images and spectra were taken.  
      * :ref:`NXinstrument`;
        conceptually this is a container to store an arbitrary level of detail of the  
        technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which  
        the microscope is operated.  
      * :ref:`NXuser`;
        conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details  
        who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be  
        referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store  
        individualized details of who executed an event of data acquisition or processing.  
      * :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;  
        each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details  
        about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and  
        relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).  
      * :ref:`NXdata`; at the top-level, this is a place for documenting available  
        default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for research data  
        management systems to show a visual representation of some  
        aspect of the content of the EM session.  
        Default plottables are not intended to serve every possible analysis and  
        visualization demand but are instead a preview. We made this choice
        because what constitutes a useful default plot is often a matter of interpretation,
        somewhat of personal taste, and community standards. In effect, default
        plottables are case- and method-specific.

      Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals.
      Examples for possible default plottables could be arbitrarily taken secondary,
      back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern, EELS spectra, composition,
      or orientation mappings to name but a few.

      **There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:**

      * Images and spectra should be stored as :ref:`NXimage_set` and :ref:`NXspectrum_set`  
        instances to hold data at the earliest possible step in the computational  
        processing (which is usually performed with the microscope control and or  
        integrated analysis software). The formatting of the NXdata groups enables the  
        display of image and spectra with web technology visualization software.  
      * When two- and three-dimensional geometric primitive data are stored, it is useful  
        to write additional optional `XDMF <https://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format>`_
        fields which support additional plotting of the data with visualization software.  
      * Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of  
        data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible  
        electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.  
      * Images based on electron counts are typically detected with specific operation modes
        such as bright field or dark field imaging in TEM or secondary/back-scattered electron
        imaging in SEM. 
      * Also spectra (X-ray quanta or Auger electron counts) typically are referred to
        under the assumption of a specific operation mode of the microscope.
      * These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical processing. 
        These data and processing steps are modelled as instances of :ref:`NXprocess`  
        which use terms from a controlled vocabulary e.g. SE (secondary electron),  
        BSE (back-scattered electron), Kikuchi, X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence).

      **A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
      should be stored (in memory or on disk)**.

      The application definition NXem is a graph which describes how numerical data
      and (meta)data for EM research are related to one another.

      Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
      commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
      In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
      at the microscope.
      Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
      interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
      of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.

      It is possible that different types of programs might be used to 
      perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is
      the case the processing should be structured with individual :ref:`NXprocess`
      instances. If the program and/or version used for processing referred
      to in an NXprocess group is different to the program and version
      mentioned in this field, the NXprocess needs
      to hold an own program and version.

          codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
          for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact

          Often though it is useful to specify a time interval by specifying both
          a start_time and an end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping and
          interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that even
          with having both time instances specified, it may not be possible
          to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data were acquired.

          More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
          to be collected to compute this. These computations can take

            the specimen from all others and especially the predecessor/origin
            from where the specimen was cut.

            This field must not be used for an alias of the sample.
            Instead, use short_title for this, more convenient alias name.

            In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
            the name has to identify the specific one, whose results are stored
            by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
            the characterization of a single specimen.

            Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
            sample history.

            of the material, its microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical
            processing/preparation history as possible.

            The sample_history is the record what happened before the specimen
            was placed into the microscope at the beginning of the session.

            In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
            available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a
            sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider are
            the key steps and relevant information about the specimen,
            its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing state,
            and the details of the preparation.

            Specific details about eventual physically-connected material like
            embedding resin should be documented ideally also in the sample_history.
            If all fails, the description field can be used but it is strongly
            discouraged because it leads to eventually non-machine-actionable
            data.

            ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information

            Ideally report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
            the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this should
            be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined handed over
            for analysis.

            Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
            especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
            hydrogen charged specimens or experiments
            including tracers with a short half time. Further time stamps prior
            to preparation_date should better be placed in resources which

            components, all elements from each component must be included in 
            `atom_types`.

            The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an

            For scanning electron microscopy, in many cases the specimen is much
            thicker than what is illuminatable by the electron beam.
            In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of
            the specimen viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal
            surface normal of the specimen is parallel to the optical axis.

            discouraged and instead an instance of an :ref:`NXinteraction_vol_em`
            within individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances can provide a much

          Metadata and numerical data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.

          The em_lab section contains a description of the instrument and its components.
          The component descriptions in this section differ from those inside individual
          NXevent_data_em sections. These event instances take the role of time snapshot.
          For an NXevent_data_em instance users should store only those settings for a 
          component which are relevant to understand the current state of the component.
          Here, current means at the point in time, i.e. the time interval, 
          which the event represents.

          For example it is not relevant to store in each event's electron_source
          group again the details of the gun type and manufacturer but only the
          high-voltage if for that event the high-voltage was different. If for all
          events the high-voltage was the same it is not even necessary to include
          an electron_source section in the event.

          Individual sections of specific type should have the following names:

          * NXaperture: the name should match with the name of the lens  
          * NXlens_em: condenser_lens, objective_lens are commonly used names  
          * NXcorrector_cs: device for correcting spherical aberrations  
          * NXstage_lab: a collection of component for holding the specimen and  
            eventual additional component for applying external stimuli on the sample  
          * NXdetector: several possible names like secondary_electron,  
            backscattered_electron, direct_electron, ebsd, edx, wds, auger,  
            cathodoluminescence, camera, ronchigram

          A container for storing a set of NXevent_data_em instances.

          An event is a time interval during which the microscope was configured
          in a specific way. The microscope is considered as stable enough during
          this interval that a measurement with one or multiple detectors is
          possible. What constitutes such time interval depends on how the
          microscope is used and which measurements the user would like to perform.

          Each NXevent_data_em instance holds one acquisition task with detectors.
          Each NXevent_data_em section contains an em_lab group in which specific
          settings and states of the microscope during the time interval
          can be stored to document the history of states of the microscope over
          the course of the session.

          The NXem application definition offers maximal flexibility.
          One extreme could be that the only one NXevent_data_em instance is used
          and this covers the time interval of the entire session at the microscope.
          The other extreme case is that each collection of an image or even
          single spot measurement is defined as an NXevent_data_em instance.
          In this case the em_lab group inside the NXevent_data_em also holds
          the specific time-dependent state of the microscope with which in theory
          all dynamics of the system (if measured) can be captured and documented.

          Nowadays microscopes exists for which hard- and software solutions
          enable a tracking of the dynamics of the microscope and the actions
          of the user (such as with solution like AXONSynchronicity from Protochips).
          The NXem application definition can however also be used for less
          complex interaction and lower demands wrt to time tracking activities.

          An NXevent_data_em instance holds specific details about how raw data from
          a detector were processed. Raw data may already be post-processed as
          they are accessible only by the control software with after some internal
          processing happened. Nevertheless, these data have to be distinguished from
          post-processed data where e.g. raw data are converted to interpreted
          spectra, or orientation mappings.

          This post-processing tasks can be performed (on-the-fly, i.e. during
          acquisition for sure during the microscope session) or afterwards.
          Post-processing is performed with commercial software or various
          types and scripts.

          Currently, several specializations of NXimage_set and Nspectrum_set
          are used which store some details of this processing. However, as post-
          processing tasks can be substantially more advanced and involved it
          is clear that data artifacts from the measurement and data artifacts
          generated during post-processing are weakly connected only, maybe
          exclusively by the fact that a complex numerical post-processing workflow
          just takes one raw dataset from an NXevent_data_em instance but generates
          multiple derived data artifacts from this. All these should be described
          as own application definitions and only weak connections should be made
          to an instance of NXem. Instances of NXsubentry is one mechanism in
          NeXus how this can be achieved in the future.

            A container holding a specific result of the measurement and
            eventually metadata how that result was obtained numerically.

            NXevent_data_em instances can hold several specific NXimage_em or
            NXspectrum_em instances taken and considered as one event, i.e.
            a point in time when the microscope had the settings specified
            either in NXinstrument or in this NXevent_data_em instance.

            The application definition is designed without an explicit need for
            having an NXevent_data_em instance that contains an NXimage_em or 
            NXspectra_em instance. Thereby, an NXevent_data_em can also be used 
            for just documentation about the specific state of the microscope
            irrespective whether data have been collected during this time interval.

            In other words the NXinstrument group details primarily the more
            static settings and components of the microscope as they are found
            by the operator during the session. The NXevent_data_em samples
            the dynamics.

            It is not necessary to store data in NXebeam, NXibeam instances
            of NXevent_data_em but in this case it is assumed that the settings
            were constant over the entire course of the microscope session
            and thus all relevant metadata inside the NXinstrument groups
            are sufficient to understand the session.

            So far there exists no standard which a majority of the technology
            partners and the materials science electron microscopy community
            have accepted which could be used for a very generic documentation,
            storage and exchange of electron microscope data. Therefore, it is
            still a frequent case that specific files have many fields which cannot
            safely be mapped or interpreted.
            **Therefore, users are always given the advice to keep the vendor files.**
            Working however with these vendor files inside specific software,
            like materials databases, demands for parsers which extract pieces of
            information from the vendor representation (numerical data and metadata)
            and map them on a schema with which the database and its associated
            software tools can work with.

            Currently, one would loose immediately track of e.g. provenance and
            the origin of certain data in NXevent_data_em instances unless really
            all data are safely and reliably copied over into an instance of the
            schema. Currently, though, this is sadly effectively prevented in many
            cases as vendors indeed implemented often sophisticated provenance
            and commercial software state tracking tools but these are not yet
            documented covering enough in our opinion so that it is safe to assume
            all vendor field names are known, logically understood, interpretable,
            and thus mappable on a common schema using a controlled common
            vocabulary.

            Therefore we encourage user for now to store for each NXimage_set
            or NXspectra_set instance to supply the so-called source of the data.
            This can for instance be the name and hashvalue of the original
            file which was acquired during the microscope session and from which then
            certain details like numerical data and metadata were copied into an
            instance of this schema for the purpose of working with the data in
            e.g. tools offered by research data management (RDM) systems or 
            materials database.

            During our work on implementing file format/metadata parsers and
            developing this application definition, we realized that **several
            software tools currently do not consistently format critical metadata
            like time-zone-aware timestamps** when events of data collection or
            processing happened.

            We would like to encourage the community and especially the vendors
            to work towards a standardization, or at least an open documentation
            of the way how time-zone-aware time data are collected and stored how
            and where during a microscope session and how they end up in files
            and databases with which users interact.
            This would enable to supplement instances of this schema with specific
            time data and assure that these time data can be used to reliably
            contextualize individual datasets and processing steps in materials
            information systems.

            For the reason that these measures have not yet been fully taken,
            the start_time and end_time is a recommended option.
            The idea behind these time-zone-aware dates is to identify when
            the data were collected at the microscope but NOT when they were
            transcoded by some software tool(s) while storing the data in an
            instance of this schema.
