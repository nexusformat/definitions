**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class of the configuration and results of a delocalization algorithm. ...

      Base class of the configuration and results of a delocalization algorithm.

      Delocalization is used to distribute point-like objects on a grid to obtain
      e.g. smoother count, composition, or concentration values of scalar fields
      and compute gradients of these fields.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_p**: Number of points/objects.

  **n_m**: Number of mark data per point/object.

  **n_atoms**: Number of atoms in the whitelist.

  **n_nuclides**: Number of isotopes in the whitelist.

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXcg_grid`, :ref:`NXmatch_filter`

          As an example from the research field of atom probe points/objects are (molecular) ions.
          Different methods are used for weighting ions:

          * default, points get all the same weight 1., which for atom probe is equivalent
             to (molecular) iontype-based delocalization.
          * element, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclide
            with a proton number that is matching to a respective entry in whitelist.
            In atom probe jargon, this means atomic_decomposition.
          * isotope, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclides
            from a respective entry in whitelist.
            In atom probe jargon, this means isotope_decomposition.

          Any of these values: ``default`` | ``element`` | ``isotope``

          A list of nuclides based on which to evaluate the weight. Nuclides need to exist in the nuclide table.

          Attribute data for each member of the point cloud. For APM these are the
          iontypes generated via ranging. The number of mark data per point is 1
          in the case for atom probe.

          Weighting factor with which the integrated intensity per grid cell is
          multiplied specifically for each point/object. For APM the weight are
          positive integer values, specifically the multiplicity of the ion,
          according to the details of the weighting_method.
