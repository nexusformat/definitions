            spectroscopy wavelength is more common, for IR wave numbers in
            1/cm units.

            Possibly use the same type of data as for the measurement.

        **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (recommended) :ref:`NXtransformations`

          The stage coordinate system vs. the incident beam. The Z-axis of the stage is considered to point along the normal of the substrate (bottom reflecting surface) from the stage towards the general direction of the light source. The beam comes with the angle of incidence towards this Z-axis, but in opposite direction, thus they are connected with a rotation of 180 - angle of incidence (in degrees).
          This transformation brings us from the NEXUS coordinates to the stage coordinates.
          Then provide the set of translations (if there are any). These all have a vector defining their relative direction in the current coordinate system. (This current coordinate system changes with every transformation if you set the parameter 'depends' to the name of the previous step.)

      **window**: (optional) :ref:`NXaperture`

        For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor, vacuum etc.) is
        enclosed in a cell or cryostat, which has windows both in the direction of the
        source and the detector (looking from the sample). These windows also add a
        phase shift to the light altering the measured signal. This shift has to be
        corrected based on measuring a known sample in the environmental cell.

        .. index:: material (field)
