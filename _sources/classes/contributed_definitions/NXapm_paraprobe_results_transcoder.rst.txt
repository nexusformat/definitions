          On a mid term perspective we would like to evolve the paraprobe-toolbox
          to an implementation stage where it works exclusively with completely
          provenance-tracked formats for both the configuration of the workflow step
          and/or analysis with each tool and also for the output of these analyses
          in the form of so-called tool-specific results files.
          Currently the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) is used to store such data.

          Different file formats can be used to inject reconstructed datasets and
          ranging definitions into the toolbox. Traditionally, these are the POS, 
          ePOS, and APT files with the tomographic reconstruction and other metadata
          and RNG and RRNG file formats for the ranging definitions how mass-to-charge
          state-ratio values map on (molecular) ion types. Such input should be
          injected via specific NeXus/HDF5 files which are documented
          in compliance with the NXapm application definition.

          So far the paraprobe-toolbox was used as a standalone tool. Therefore, it
          was not relevant during the development to focus on interoperability.
          Essentially paraprobe-transcoder was used as a parser to transcode data
          in the above-mentioned file formats into a paraprobe-specific
          representation. This transcoding should become deprecated.
          Here we describe steps we have taken into this direction.

          With the work in the FAIRmat project and the desire to make the paraprobe-
          toolbox also accessible as a cloud-computing capable service in the Nomad
          Remote Tools Hub (NORTH) the topic of interoperability became more important
          and eventually the NXapm application definition was proposed.
          NORTH is a GUI and related service in a NOMAD OASIS instance which allows
          to spawn preconfigured docker containers via JupyterHub.
          Currently, NORTH includes the so-called apm container. A container with
          tools specific for analyzing data from atom probe microscopy as well as
          processing of point cloud and mesh data.

          The NXapm application definition and related implementation work within
          NOMAD OASIS enabled users to parse content of POS, ePOS, APT, RNG, and
          RRNG files, surplus key metadata from vendor-agnostic electronic lab notebook
          solutions directly into NOMAD OASIS via the uploads section.
          The process is automated and yields an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5 file
          inside the uploads section in return.

          With these improvements made there is no longer a need for - at least the
          users of a NOMAD OASIS and NORTH instance to use the deprecated 
          PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.*.h5 files. Ideally, paraprobe should
          automatically detect that the input can now be an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5
          file and in response work with this file directly.
          To remain compliant with users however who do not have or do not wish
          to use a NOMAD OASIS or NXapm or NeXus at all right now, the solution is
          as follows:

          Calling the configuration stage of paraprobe-transcoder is always mandatory.
          It is always the first step of working with the toolbox. In this process
          the user defines the input files. These can either be nxs i.e. the NXapm/NeXus/
          HDF5 file from e.g. the upload section, or such a file that was obtained from
          a colleague with a NOMAD OASIS instance.
          In all other cases, users can pass the reconstruction and ranging definitions
          using the traditional POS, ePOS, or APT and RNG or RRNG file formats respectively.

          Based on which input the user delivers, the parmsetup-transcoder tool then
          creates a configuration file PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs and
          informs the user whether the input was NeXus (and thus if all relevant
          input is already available) or whether the paraprobe-transcoder tool needs
          to be executed to convert the content of the vendor files first into a
          format which paraprobe can provenance track and understand.
          In the latter case, the PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file is
          used to communicate to all subsequently used tools from which files
          the tools can expect to find the reconstruction and ranging definitions.

          All subsequent analysis steps start also with a tool-specific configuration.
          This configuration step reads in (among others) the
          PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file from which the configuration
          tool identifies automatically whether to read the reconstruction and ranging data
          from PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.SimID.*.h5 or directly the NXapm-compliant
          NeXus/HDF5 file that was created upon preparing the upload or the file shared
          from a colleague. This design removes the need for unnecessary copies of the data.
          Currently still though users should execute the transcoder step as it will
          generate a supplementary XDMF topology field with which the data in either
          the NeXus/HDF5 or the transcoded vendor files can be displayed using e.g.
          Paraview. For this purpose XDMF is used.

          Of course ideally the APT community would at some point converge to use
          a common data exchange file format. To this end, AMETEK/Cameca's APT file format
          could be a good starting point but so far it is lacking a consistent way of
          how to store generalized ranging definitions and post-processing results.
          POS, ePOS, Rouen's ATO, as well as other so far used representations of data
          like CSV or text files have, to the best of our current knowledge, no
          concept of how to marry reconstruction and (optional) ranging data into
          one self-descriptive format.

          This summarizes the rationale behind the current choices of the I/O for
          paraprobe. Furthermore, this summarizes also why the fundamental design
          of splitting an analysis always into steps of configuration (with parmsetup),
          task execution (with the respective C/C++ or Python tool of the toolbox),
          and post-processing (e.g. with autoreporter) is useful because it offers
          a clear description of provenance tracking. This is a necessary step to make
          atom probe microscopy data at all better aligned with the aims of the
          FAIR principles.

          The internal organization of the data entries in the atom_probe group
          in this application definition for paraprobe-transcoder results files
          mirror the definitions of the NXapm for consistency reasons.
