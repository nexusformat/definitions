          Discretization and distributing of the ion point cloud on a 3D grid
          to enable analyses at the continuum scale.

          By default, the tool computes a full kernel density estimation of decomposed
          ions to create one discretized field for each element.

          One delocalization task configures a parameter sweep with at least one
          delocalization. The total number of runs depends on the number of
          grid_resolution and kernel_variance values. For example, setting two grid_resolutions
          and three kernel_variance will compute six runs. Two sets of three with the first set using
          the first grid_resolutions and in sequence the kernel_variance respectively.

        .. collapse:: Matrix of nuclides representing how iontypes should be accounted for durin ...

            Matrix of nuclides representing how iontypes should be accounted for during
            the delocalization. This is the most general approach to define if and how many
            times an ion is to be counted. The tool performs a so-called atomic decomposition
            of all iontypes, i.e. the tool analyses from how many atoms of each nuclide
            or element respectively an (molecular) ion is built from.

            Taking the hydroxonium H3O+ molecular ion as an example:
            It contains hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The multiplicity of hydrogen
            is three whereas that of oxygen is one. Therefore, the respective atomic decomposition
            analysis prior to the iso-surface computation adds three hydrogen counts for each
            H3O+ ion.

            This is a practical solution which accepts that on the one hand not every bond is
            broken during an atom probe experiment but also that ions may react further during
            their flight to the detector. The exact details depend on the local field conditions,
            quantum mechanics of possible electron transfer and thus the detailed trajectory
            of the system and its electronic state.

            The detection of molecular ions instead of always single atom ions only is the
            reason that an atom probe experiment tells much about field evaporation physics
            but also faces an inherent loss of information with respect to the detailed spatial
            arrangement that is independent of other imprecisions such as effect of limited
            accuracy of reconstruction protocols and their parameterization.

            Unused values in each row of the matrix are nullified.
            Nuclides are identified as hashed nuclide (see :ref:`NXatom`) for further details.

            Configuration of the set of iso-surfaces to compute using that delocalization.
            Such iso-surfaces are the starting point for a reconstruction of so-called objects or
            (microstructural) features. Examples of scientific relevant are (line features e.g. dislocations
            poles, surface features such as interfaces, i.e. phase and grain boundaries, or volumetric
            features such as precipitates.
            Users should be aware that reconstructed datasets in atom probe are a model and may face
            inaccuracies and artifacts that can be mistaken incorrectly as microstructural features.

              As it is detailed in `M. Kühbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_, the handling of
              triangles at the surface (edge) of the dataset requires special attention especially for
              composition-normalized delocalization. Here, it is possible that the composition
              increases towards the edge of the dataset because the quotient of two numbers
              that are both smaller than one is larger instead of smaller than the counter.

              By default, the tool uses a modified marching cubes algorithm of Lewiner et al.
              which detects if voxels face such a situation. In this case, no triangles are generated
              for such voxels.

              Alternatively, keep_edge_triangles instructs the tool to not remove triangles at the
              edge of the dataset at the cost of bias. When using this keep_edge_triangles users
              should understand that all features in contact with the edge of the dataset get usually
              artificial enlarged. Consequently, triangulated surface meshes of these objects are
              closed during the marching. However, this closure is artificial and can bias shape
              analyses for those objects. This also holds for such practices that are offered in
              proprietary software like IVAS / AP Suite. The situation is comparable to analyses
              of grain shapes via orientation microscopy from electron microscopy or X-ray
              diffraction tomography. Features at the edge of the dataset may have not been
              captured fully.

              Thanks to collaboration with V. V. Rielli and S. Primig from the Sydney atom probe group,
              paraprobe-nanochem implements a complete pipeline to process features at the edge of the
              dataset. Specifically, these are modelled and replaced with closed polyhedral objects using
              an iterative mesh and hole-filling procedures with fairing operations.

              The tool bookkeeps such objects separately to lead the decision whether or not to
              consider these objects to the user. Users should be aware that results from fairing operations
              should be compared to results from analyses where all objects at the edge
              of the dataset have been removed. Furthermore, users should be careful with overestimating
              the statistical significance of their dataset especially when using atom probe when they
              use their atom probe result to compare different descriptors. Even though a dataset may
              deliver statistically significant results for compositions, this does not necessarily mean that
              same dataset will also yield statistically significant and insignificantly biased results for
              3D object analyses!

              Being able to quantify these effects and making atom probers aware of these subtleties
              was one of the main reasons why the paraprobe-nanochem tool was implemented.

              The ion-to-surface distance that is used in the analyses of features to identify whether
              these are laying inside the dataset or close to the surface (edge) of the dataset.

              If an object has at least one ion with an ion-to-surface-distance below this threshold,
              the object is considered close to the edge of the dataset. The tool uses a distance-based
              approach to solve the in general complicated and involved treatment of computing
              volumetric intersections between closed 2-manifolds that are not necessarily convex.
              The main practical reason is that such computational geometry analyses face numerical
              robustness issues as a consequence of which a mesh can be detected as being completely
              inside another mesh although in reality it is only :math:`\epsilon`-close only, i.e. almost
              touching only the edge (e.g. from inside).

              Practically, humans would likely still state in such case that the object is close to the
              edge of the dataset; however mathematically the object is indeed completely inside.
              In short, a distance-based approach is rigorous and flexible.

              subsequent analyses for each iso-surface. The unit depends on the choice for the
              normalization of the accumulated ion intensity values per voxel:

              * total, total number of ions, irrespective their iontype
              * candidates, total number of ions with type in the isotope_whitelist.
              * composition, candidates but normalized by composition, i.e. at.-%
              * concentration, candidates but normalized by voxel volume, i.e. ions/nm^3

              because different sub-set may not be connected.

              Each triangle is reported with an ID specifying to which triangle cluster (with IDs starting at zero)
              the triangle belongs. The clustering of triangles within the soup is performed with a
              modified DBScan algorithm.

              Specifies if the tool should analyze for each cluster of triangles how they can be combinatorially
              processed to describe a closed polyhedron. Such a closed polyhedron (not-necessarily convex!)
              can be used to describe objects with relevance in the microstructure.

              Users should be aware that the resulting mesh does not necessarily represent the original precipitate.
              In fact, inaccuracies in the reconstructed positions cause inaccuracies in all downstream processing
              operations. Especially the effect on one-dimensional spatial statistics like nearest neighbor correlation
              functions were discussed in the literature `B. Gault et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012952>`_.

              In continuation of these thoughts, this applies also to reconstructed objects.
              A well-known example is the discussion of shape deviations of scandium-rich precipitates in aluminum alloys
              which in reconstructions may appear as ellipsoids although they should be indeed almost spherical
              provided their size is larger than the atomic length scale.

              Specifies if the tool should report a triangulated surface mesh for each identified closed polyhedron.
              It is common that a marching cubes algorithm creates iso-surfaces with a fraction of tiny sub-complexes
              (e.g. small isolated tetrahedra).

              These can be small tetrahedra/polyhedra about the center of a voxel of the support grid
              on which marching cubes operates. Such objects may not contain an ion; especially when considering
              that delocalization procedures smoothen the positions of the ions. Although these small objects are
              interesting from a numerical point of view, scientists may argue they are not worth to be reported because
              a microstructural feature should contain at least a few atoms to become relevant.
              Therefore, paraprobe-nanochem by default does not report closed objects which bound a volume
              that contains no ion.

              Specifies if the tool should report for each closed polyhedron an approximately optimal bounding box
              fitted to all triangles of the surface mesh of the object and ion positions inside or on the surface of the mesh.
              This bounding box informs about the closed object's shape (aspect ratios).

              Users should be aware that the choice of the algorithm to compute the bounding box can have an
              effect on aspect ratio statistics. It is known that computing the true optimal bounding box of in 3D
              is an :math:`\mathcal{O}^3`-time-complex task. The tool uses well-established approximate algorithms
              of the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL).

              Specifies if the tool should report for each closed polyhedron all evaporation IDs of those ions which
              lay inside or on the boundary of the polyhedron. This information is used by the paraprobe-intersector
              tool to infer if two objects share common ions, which is then understood as that the two objects intersect.

              Users should be aware that two arbitrarily closed polyhedra in three-dimensional space can intersect
              but not share a common ion. In fact, the volume bounded by the polyhedron has sharp edges and flat
              face(t)s. When taking two objects, an edge of one object may for instance pierce into the surface of
              another object. In this case the objects partially overlap / intersect volumetrically; however this piercing
              might be so small or happening in the volume between two reconstructed ion positions. Consequently,
              sharing ions is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for interpreting (volumetric) intersections
              between objects.

              Paraprobe-intersector implements a rigorous alternative to handle such intersections using a tetrahedralization
              of closed objects. However, in many practical cases, we found through examples that there are polyhedra (especially when they are non-convex and have almost point-like) connected channels, where
              tetrahedralization libraries have challenges dealing with. In this case, checking intersections
              via shared_ions is a more practical alternative.

              surface mesh and the triangles of the edge model is larger than edge_threshold.
              If this is the case, the object is assumed to be deeply embedded in the interior of the dataset.
              Otherwise, the object is considered to have an edge contact, i.e. it shape is likely affected by the edge.

              combinatorial analysis according to has_object returned that the object is not a closed polyhedron.
              Such proxies are closed via iterative hole-filling, mesh refinement, and fairing operations.

              Users should be aware that the resulting mesh does not necessarily represent the original feature.
              In most cases objects, precipitates in atom probe end up as open objects because they have been
              clipped by the edge of the dataset. Using a proxy is in this case a strategy to still be able to account
              for these objects. However, users should make themselves familiar with the consequences and
              potential bias which this can introduce into the analysis.

              with the edge the dataset. Currently, the tool supports cylindrical ROIs. A computational geometry test is
              performed to check for a possible intersection of each ROI with the triangulated surface mesh that is defined
              via surface. Results of this cylinder-set-of-triangles intersection are interpreted as follows:
              If the cylinder intersects with at least one triangle of the surface (mesh) the ROI is assumed to make edge contact.
              Otherwise, the ROI is assumed to make  no edge contact.

              Users should note that this approach does not work if the ROI is laying completely outside the dataset as also
              in this case the cylinder intersects with any triangle. However, for atom probe this case is practically irrelevant
              provided constructions such as alpha shapes or alpha wrappings (such as paraprobe-surfacer does) about the
              ions of the entire reconstructed volume are used.

          Use a principle component analysis (PCA) to mesh a single free-standing interface patch within
          the reconstructed volume that is decorated by ions of specific iontypes (e.g. solute atoms).

          Interface_meshing is a typical starting point for the quantification of Gibbsian interfacial excess
          in cases when closed objects constructed from patches e.g. iso-surfaces are not available or
          when there is no substantial or consistently oriented concentration gradients across an interface
          patch. The functionality can also be useful when the amount of latent crystallographic information
          within the point cloud is insufficient or when combined with interface_meshing based on ion density
          traces in field-desorption maps (see `Y. Wei et al. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225041>`_
          and `A. Breen et al. <https://github.com/breen-aj/detector>`_ for details).

          Noteworthy to mention is that the method used is conceptually similar to the work of `Z. Peng et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016112>`_ and related work (DCOM algorithm) by `P. Felfer et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.06.002>`_. Compared to these implementations
          paraprobe-nanochem uses inspection functionalities which detect potential geometric
          inconsistencies or self-interactions of the evolved DCOM mesh.

      .. collapse:: Analysis of one-dimensional profiles in ROIs placed in the dataset. ...

          Analysis of one-dimensional profiles in ROIs placed in the dataset.
          Such analyses are useful for quantifying interfacial excess or for
          performing classical composition analyses.

          The tool will test for each ROIs if it is completely embedded in the dataset.
          Specifically, each such test evaluates if the ROI cuts at least one triangle
          of the triangulated surface mesh that is referred to by surface.
          If this is the case the ROI is marked as one close to the surface
          and not analyzed further. Otherwise, the ROI is marked as one far
          from the surface and processed further.

          For each ROI the tool computes atomically decomposed profiles.
          This means, molecular ions are split into nuclides as many times as
          their respective multiplicity. For each processed ROI the tool stores
          a sorted list of signed distance values to enable post-processing with
          other software like e.g. reporter to perform classical
          Krakauer/Seidman-style interfacial excess analyses.

          Users should be aware that the latter intersection analysis is not
          a volumetric intersection analysis. Given that the triangulated mesh
          referred to in surface is not required to mesh neither a watertight
          nor convex polyhedron a rigorous testing of volumetric intersection
          is much more involved. If the mesh is watertight one could use split
          the task in first tessellating the mesh into convex polyhedra (e.g.
          tetrahedra and apply a volumetric intersection method like the
          Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm (GJK). In cases when the mesh is not
          even watertight distance-based segmentation in combination with again
          intersection of triangles and convex polyhedra is a robust but currently
          not implemented method to quantify intersections.
