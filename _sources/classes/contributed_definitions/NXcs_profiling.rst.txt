      Computer science description for summary performance/profiling data of an application.

      Performance monitoring and benchmarking of software is a task where questions
      can be asked at various levels of detail. In general, there are three main
      contributions to performance:

      * Hardware capabilities and configuration
      * Software configuration and capabilities
      * Dynamic effects of the system in operation and the system working together
        with eventually multiple computers, especially when these have to exchange
        information across a network.

      At the most basic level users may wish to document how long e.g. a data
      analysis with a scientific software (app).
      A frequent idea is here to judge how critical the effect is on the workflow
      of the scientists, i.e. is the analysis possible in a few seconds or would it
      take days if I were to run this analysis on a comparable machine. In this case,
      mainly the order of magnitude is relevant, as well as how this can be achieved
      with using parallelization (i.e. reporting the number of CPU and GPU resources
      used, the number of processes and/or threads, and basic details about the
      computing node/computer.

      At more advanced levels benchmarks may go as deep as detailed temporal tracking
      of individual processor instructions, their relation to other instructions, the
      state of call stacks, in short eventually the entire app execution history
      and hardware state history. Such analyses are mainly used for performance
      optimization as well as for tracking bugs and other development purposes.
      Specialized software exists which documents such performance data in
      specifically-formatted event log files or databases.

      This base class cannot and should not replace these specific solutions.
      Instead, the intention of the base class is to serve scientists at the 
      basic level to enable simple monitoring of performance data and log profiling
      data of key algorithmic steps or parts of computational workflows, so that
      these pieces of information can guide users which order of magnitude differences
      should be expected or not.

      Developers of application definitions should add additional fields and
      references to e.g. more detailed performance data to which they wish to link
      the metadata in this base class.

        Wall-clock time how long the app execution took. This may be in principle
        end_time minus start_time; however usage of eventually more precise timers
        may warrant to use a finer temporal discretization,
        and thus demand a more precise record of the wall-clock time.

  .. _/NXcs_profiling/number_of_processes-field:

  .. index:: number_of_processes (field)

  **number_of_processes**: (optional) :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Qualifier which specifies with how many nominal processes the app was  ...

        Qualifier which specifies with how many nominal processes the app was 
        invoked. The main idea behind this field, for instance for app using a
        Message Passing Interface parallelization is to communicate how many
        processes were used.

        For sequentially running apps number_of_processes and number_of_threads
        is 1. If the app uses exclusively GPU parallelization number_of_gpus
        can be larger than 1. If no GPU is used number_of_gpus is 0 even though
        the hardware may have GPUs installed, thus indicating these were not
        used though.

        Qualifier with how many nominal threads were accessible to the app at
        runtime. Specifically here the maximum number of threads used for the
        high-level threading library used (e.g. OMP_NUM_THREADS), posix.
