    .. collapse:: Type of the amplifier base on the response on frequency. ...

        Type of the amplifier base on the response on frequency.

        Any of these values or a custom value (if you use a custom value, also set @custom=True):

          * ``low-pass``: A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency and  attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.

          * ``high-pass``: A high-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.

          * ``band-pass``: A band-pass filter is a filter that passes signals within a certain frequency range and attenuates signals outside that range.

          * ``band-stop``: A band-stop filter is a filter (opposite to the band-pass) that attenuates signals within a certain frequency range and passes signals outside that range.

          * ``broadband``: A broadband filter is a filter that passes signals over a wide range of frequencies with minimal attenuation.

        amplification of the amplifier. (array for active channels)

        The ratio of the amplitude of the target signal to the amplitude of the noise in

        The unwanted coupling between different channels (if active >1).
        In ideal amplifier, channels are independent of each other, But due to different resources
        sharing (e.g., same power supply, electromagnetic interference), there may have some 
        unwanted coupling between different channels, which is called crosstalk.
