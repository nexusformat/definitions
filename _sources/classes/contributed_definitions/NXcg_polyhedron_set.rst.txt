**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a polyhedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a polyhedra in Euclidean space.

      Polyhedra, also so-called cells (especially in the convex of tessellations),
      here described have to be all non-degenerated, closed, built of and thus
      built out of not-self-intersecting polygon meshes. Polyhedra may make contact,
      so that this base class can be used for a future description of tessellations.

      For more complicated manifolds and especially for polyhedra with holes, users
      are advised to check if their particular needs are described by creating
      (eventually customized) instances of an NXcg_polygon_set, which can be
      extended for the description of piecewise-linear complexes.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polyhedra.

  **n_e_total**: The total number of edges for all polyhedra.

  **n_f_total**: The total number of faces for all polyhedra.

        The number of faces for each polyhedron. Faces of adjoining polyhedra

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        polyhedra. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
