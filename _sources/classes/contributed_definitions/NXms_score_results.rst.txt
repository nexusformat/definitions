**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Application definition for storing results of the SCORE cellular automaton. ...

      Application definition for storing results of the SCORE cellular automaton.

      The SCORE cellular automaton model for primary recrystallization is an
      example of typical materials engineering applications used within the field
      of so-called Integral Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) whereby
      one can simulate the evolution of microstructures.

      Specifically the SCORE model can be used to simulate the growth of static
      recrystallization nuclei. The model is described in the literature:

      * `M. Kühbach et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2016.01.068>`_  
      * `C. Haase et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2015.08.057>`_

          that this structure is mainly at the micron length scale.
