**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

      In generally speaking a cantilever resembles a leaf-spring which can be treated as a
      harmonic oscillator as a first approximation.

      Note: If any field data in this group comes in an array as input or output in the scan process they will
      be stored in NXdata in scan_control group.
