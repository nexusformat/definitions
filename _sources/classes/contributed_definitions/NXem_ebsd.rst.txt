  .. collapse:: Application definition for collecting and indexing Kikuchi pattern into orientat ...

      Application definition for collecting and indexing Kikuchi pattern into orientation maps.

      This NXem_ebsd application is a proposal how to represent data, metadata, and
      connections between these for the research field of electron microscopy.
      More specifically, exemplified here for electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).
      The application definition solves two key documentation issues which are missing
      so far to document provenance of data and metadata in the field of EBSD.
      The application definition can be an example that is relevant for related
      workflows in orientation microscopy.

      Firstly, an instance of NXem_ebsd (such as a NeXus/HDF5 file which is formatted
      according to the NXem_ebsd application definition) stores the connection between
      the microscope session and the key datasets which are considered typically results
      of the various processing steps involved when working with EBSD data.

      Different groups in this application definition make connections to data artifacts
      which were collected when working with electron microscopes via the NXem partner
      application definition. Using a file which stores information according to the
      NXem application definition has the benefit that it connects the sample, references
      to the sample processing, the user operating the microscope, details about the
      microscope session, and details about the acquistion and eventual indexing of
      Kikuchi pattern, associated overview images, like secondary electron or
      backscattered electron images of the region-of-interest probed and many
      more pieces of information.

      Secondly, this NXem_ebsd application definition connects and stores the conventions
      and reference frames which were used and are the key to mathematically correctly
      interpret every EBSD result. Otherwise, results would be ripped out of their
      context, as it is the situation with many traditional studies where EBSD data were
      indexed on-the-fly and shared with the community only via sharing the results file
      with some technology-partner-specific file but leaving important conventions out
      or relying on the assumptions that colleagues know these even though multiple
      definitions are possible.

      This application definition covers experiments with one-, two-dimensional, and
      so-called three-dimensional EBSD datasets. The third dimension is either time
      (in the case of quasi in-situ experiments) or space (in the case of serial-
      sectioning) methods where a combination of mechanical or ion milling is used
      repetitively to measure the same region-of-interest at different depth increments.
      Material removal can be achieved with electron or ion polishing, using manual
      steps or using automated equipment like a robot system.

      Three-dimensional experiments require to follow a sequence of specimen, surface
      preparation, and data collection steps. By nature these methods are destructive
      in that they either require the removal of the previously measured material region
      or that the sample surface can degrade due to e.g. contamination or other
      electron-matter interaction.

      For three-dimensional EBSD, multiple two-dimensional EBSD orientation mappings are
      combined into one reconstructed stack. That is serial-sectioning is mainly a
      computational workflow. Users collect data for each serial sectioning step
      via an experiment. This assures that data for associated microscope sessions
      and steps of data processing stay connected and contextualized.

      Eventual tomography methods also use such a workflow because first diffraction
      images are collected (e.g. with X-ray) and then these imagres are indexed and
      computed into a 3D orientation mapping. The here proposed NXem_ebsd application
      definition contains conceptual ideas how this splitting between measurement and
      post-processing can be granularized also for such X-ray-based techniques, whether
      it be 3DXRD or HEDM.

          for referring to this workflow.

          The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
          or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
          workflows/experiments to e.g. proposals.

          Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the respective
          field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields of the application
          definition behind instead of filling in these details into the experiment_description
          free-text description field.

          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          included when the processing of the workflow started.
          If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
          application definition should only be used for specifying when the
          workflow was executed - and the exact duration is not relevant
          - this start_time field should be used.

          Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
          both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
          and interpretation of the workflow.

          Details about simulations for Kikuchi pattern using kinematic or dynamic
          diffraction theory. Usually, the output of such computer simulations are
          spherical Kikuchi images which only when projected or observed in some
          region-of-interest will represent a set of rectangular Kikuchi pattern
          with the same rectangular shape and image size.

          Therefore, these pattern should be stored. The spherical diffraction
          pattern can be stored as a set of triangulated geodesic meshes.
          The rectangular patterns should be stored as NXimage_set_em_kikuchi stack.

          Do not store pattern in the simulation group if they
          have been measured are not simulated.

          The experiment group captures relevant details about the conditions of
          and the tools used for collecting the Kikuchi diffraction pattern.

          The most frequently collected EBSD data are captured as rectangular ROIs
          composed from square or hexagonally-shaped pixels. Substantially less
          frequently, because such experiments are more costly and technically
          demanding, correlated experiments are performed.

          One important class of such correlated experiments are the so-called
          (quasi) in-situ experiments. Here the same or nearly the same ROI is
          analyzed via a cycles of thermomechanical treatment, sample preparation,
          measurement, on-the-fly-indexing. Phenomena investigated like this are
          recrystallization, strain accumulation, material damage.
          Post-processing is required to correlate and reidentify eventual
          features or local ROIs across several orientation maps.

          Another important class of correlated experiments are the so-called
          serial-sectioning experiments. Here the same sample is repetitively measured
          and polished to create a stack of orientation data which can be reconstructed
          to a three-dimensional volume ROI.

        .. collapse:: The EBSD system, including components like the electron gun, pole-piece, ...

            The EBSD system, including components like the electron gun, pole-piece,
            stage tilting, EBSD detector, and the gnomonic projection have to be
            calibrated to achieve reliable results. Specifically, the gnomonic projection
            has to be calibrated.

            In most practical cases, especially in engineering, there is a substantially
            larger number of sessions where such a calibrated system is used assuming
            that somebody has properly calibrated the system rather than that the user
            actively recalibrates it or is even allowed to do so.
            Especially the projection geometry has to calibrated which is usually
            achieved with measuring silicon, quartz or standards, and comparing
            against simulated diffraction pattern.

            In the first case, the user assumes that the principle geometry of the
            hardware components and the settings in the control and EBSD pattern
            acquisition software are calibrated. Consequently, users pick from an
            existent library of phase candidates. One example are the CRY or CIF
            files of the classical HKL/Channel 5/Flamenco software products.
            Each entry of the library of such phase candidates in this NeXus proposal
            is represented by one NXem_ebsd_crystal_structure_model base class.
            For each phase an instance of this base class is to be used to store
            crystallographic and simulation-relevant data.

            Indexing is a data processing step performed after/during the beam scans
            the specimen (depends on configuration). Users load the specimen, and first
            collect a coarse image of the surface. Next, an approximate value for the
            calibrated working distance is chosen and the stage tilted.
            Users then may configure the microscope for collecting higher quality data
            and push in the EBSD detector. Subsequently, they fine tune the illumination
            and aberration settings and select one or multiple ROIs to machine off.
            The on-the-fly indexing parameter are defined and usually the automated
            measurement queue started.

            Nowadays, this is usually an automated/unsupervised process. The pattern
            collection runs during the allocated session time slot which the user has
            booked ends or when the queue finishes prematurely. Kikuchi pattern surplus
            eventually multi-modal detector signals are collected and usually indexed
            on-the-fly. The Kikuchi patterns may or not be deleted directly after a
            solution was found (on-the-fly) so Kikuchi pattern are not always stored.

            Results files are in many labs afterwards copied automatically
            for archival purposes to certain storage locations. The result of such an
            EBSD measurement/experiment is a set of usually proprietary or open files
            from technology partners (microscope and EBSD detector manufacturers).

            In the second case, the system is being calibrated during the session
            using standards (silicon, quartz, or other common specimens).
            There is usually one person in each lab responsible for doing such
            calibrations. Important is that often this person or technician(s) are also
            in charge of configuring the graphical user interface and software
            with which most users control and perform their analyses.
            For EBSD this has key implications because, taking TSL OIM/EDAX as an example,
            the conventions how orientations are stored is affected by how reference frames
            are set up and this setup is made at the level of the GUI software.
            Unfortunately, these pieces of information are not necessarily stored
            in the results files. In effect, key conventions become disconnected
            from the data so it remains the users personal obligation to remember these
            settings, write them down in the lab notebook, or these metadata get lost.
            All these issues are a motivation and problem which NXem_ebsd solves.

              When NXem is not used or the aim is to rather explore first how
              community-specific files with EBSD data, such as ANG, CPR, or HDF5-
              based formats can be parsed from, inject here the name of that file.

              The em_om parser will currently not interpret the majority of the
              many system- and technique-specific metadata which come with the
              files from e.g. technology partners. This is because the current
              culture in the EBSD community is that many of the metadata fields
              are neither in all cases fully documented nor use a standardized
              vocabulary although many people understand terms from different
              implementations and how these metadata can likely be compared to
              one another.

              In addition, it is common practice in the research field of EBSD that
              users transcode their raw data into other (often text-based or HDF5)
              files with custom formatting to realize an information transfer
              between specific software tools including commercial software from
              technology partner, custom scripts in Matlab using tools like MTex,
              or Python scripting with tools like hyperspy, pyxem, orix, diffsims,
              kikuchipy, or EBSD data stack alignment tools like DREAM.3D.
              We have opted that in the first iteration this implementation of a
              RDMS-agnostic FAIR data schema for EBSD that we discard these metadata
              because these ad hoc file formats are not designed to communicate
              also specifically and most importantly the eventually different context
              of the metadata.
              Another reason for this choice was also to emphasize that in fact such
              challenges do exist in the community and thus pointing them out may
              support the discussion to arrive at eventually more complete solutions.
              As developing these solutions should not be our authority and necessarily
              demands feedback from the technology partners, we have opted for this
              intermediate approach to stimulate discussion.

            OIM, orientation imaging microscopy. Post-processing of the Kikuchi
            patterns to obtain orientation per phase model and scan point.
            Fundamentally different algorithms can be used to index EBSD/EBSP pattern.

            Common is that pattern indexing is a computational step of comparing
            simulated with measured diffraction pattern. Quality descriptors are defined
            based on which an indexing algorithm yields a quantitative measure of
            how similar measured and assumed/simulated pattern are, and thus if
            no, one, or multiple so-called solutions were found.

            Assumed or simulated pattern use kinematical or dynamical electron
            diffraction theory. Hough transform (which is essentially a discretized
            Radon transform, for details see e.g A short introduction to the Radon
            and Hough transforms and how they relate by M. van Ginkel et al.).
            Recently, dictionary-based indexing methods are increasingly becoming used
            partly driven by the move to use artificial intelligence algorithms.

            An inspection of publicly available EBSD datasets with an open-source
            license which are available on Zenodo was performed prior to implementing
            of the associated em_om parser for NXem_ebsd. This analysis revealed that
            EBSD data are in most cases stored in two ways: Case one was via a file in
            formats from technology partners. Examples are binary formats like OSC,
            H5OINA, OIP, EBSP, and many derived text-based formats like CPR, CRC, ANG,
            CTF, HKL and more. Recently, there is trend towards using HDF5-based formats.

            These files contain some result and metadata to the numerical steps and the
            computational workflow which was performed to index Kikuchi pattern
            on-the-fly. Examples of metadata include scan point positions, indexing
            solutions per scan point, some quality descriptors for the solutions,
            as well as crystal structure and phase metadata.

            Case two were raw pattern in some custom format, often text-based with
            some but in general no conclusive and interoperable representation of all
            relevant metadata.
            Often it remains unclear what individual fields and data arrays of these
            fields resolve and/or mean conceptually. For some fields, publications were
            referred to. However, software tools change over time and thus which specific
            data end in a file and which specific conceptual information is behind
            these data can change with software versions.

            Other cases were storing results of custom post-processing steps and
            associated Kikuchi pattern. Testing of advanced indexing, pseudo-symmetry
            resolving methods, i.e. any sort of prototyping or alternative indexing
            strategies so far seem to require some flexibility for implementing
            rapid prototypic capabilities. The drawback of this is that such results
            come formatted on a case-by-case basis and are thus not interoperable.

            Therefore, we first need to collect how these files have been generated
            and which metadata in these files (or database entries) represent
            which pieces of information conceptually. Ideally, one would do so by
            creating a complete set of information in e.g. an NXem application definition,
            such as a log of timestamped events and processing steps, metadata and data.
            Eventually even interactions with the graphical user interface of commercial
            software during the microscope session should be stored and become a
            part of the application definition.

            Such a set of pieces of information could then be used via reading directly
            for the NXem application definition. However, in most cases such a data
            representation is not available yet.

          .. collapse:: How many phases i.e. crystal structure models were used to index each ...

              How many phases i.e. crystal structure models were used to index each
              scan point if any? Let's assume an example to explain how this field
              should be used: In the simplest case users collected one pattern for
              each scan point and have indexed using one phase, i.e. one instance
              of an NXem_ebsd_crystal_structure_model.

              In another example users may have skipped some scan points (not indexed)
              them at all) and/or used differing numbers of phases for different scan
              points.

              The cumulated of this array decodes how phase_identifier and phase_matching
              arrays have to be interpreted. In the simplest case (one pattern per scan
              point, and all scan points indexed using that same single phase model),
              phase_identifier has as many entries as scan points
              and phase_matching has also as many entries as scan points.

        .. _/NXem_ebsd/ENTRY/experiment/indexing/phase_identifier-field:

        .. index:: phase_identifier (field)

        **phase_identifier**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [i]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

          .. collapse:: The array n_phases_per_scan_point details how the phase_identifier ...

              The array n_phases_per_scan_point details how the phase_identifier
              and the phase_matching arrays have to be interpreted.

              For the example with a single phase phase_identifier has trivial
              values either 0 (no solution) or 1 (solution matching
              sufficiently significant with the model for phase 1).

              When there are multiple phases, it is possible (although not frequently
              needed) that a pattern matches eventually (not equally well) sufficiently
              significant with multiple pattern. This can especially happen in cases of
              pseudosymmetry and more frequently with an improperly calibrated system
              or false or inaccurate phase models e.g. (ferrite, austenite).
              Having such field is especially relevant for recent machine learning
              or dictionary based indexing schemes because in combination with
              phase_matching these fields communicate the results in a model-agnostic
              way.

              Depending on the n_phases_per_scan_point value phase_identifier and
              phase_matching arrays represent a collection of concatenated tuples,
              which are organized in sequence: The solutions for the 0-th scan point,
              the 1-th scan point, the n_sc - 1 th scan point and omitting tuples
              for those scan points with no phases according to n_phases_per_scan_point

          .. collapse:: Default inverse pole figure (IPF) plot of the data specific for each ...

              Default inverse pole figure (IPF) plot of the data specific for each
              phase. No ipf_mapID instances for non-indexed scan points as these are
              by definition assigned the null phase with phase_identifier 0.

              The IPF mapping is interpolated from the scan point data mapping
              onto a rectangular domain with square pixels and the
              orientations colored according to the coloring scheme used in the
              respective ipf_color_modelID/program.

              The main purpose of the ipf_mapID group is not to keep raw data or
              scan point related data but offer a default way how a research data
              management system can display a preview of the dataset so that users
              working with the RDMS can get an overview of the dataset.

              This matches the first aim of NXem_ebsd which is foremost to bring
              colleagues and users of EBSD together to discuss which pieces of information
              need to be stored together. We are convinced a step-by-step design and
              community-driven discussion about which pieces of information should
              and/or need to be included is a practical strategy to work towards an
              interoperable description and data model for exchanging
              data from EBSD between different tools and research data management
              systems (RDMS).

              With this design the individual RDMS solutions and tools can still continue
              to support specific custom data analyses workflow and routes but at least
              there is then one common notation of understanding whereby also users
              not necessarily expert in all the details of the EBSD story can understand
              better these data and thus eventually this can motivate data reuse and
              repurposing.

              It is important to mention that we cannot assume, at least for now,
              that the parser which writes to an NXem_ebsd-compliant file is also
              responsible or capable at all of computing the inverse pole figure
              color keys and maps itself. This cannot be assumed working because
              this mapping of orientation data uses involved mathematical algorithms
              and functions which not every tools used in the EBSD community is capable
              of using or is for sure not using in exactly the same way.

              Currently, we assume it is the responsibilty of the tool used which
              generated the data under on_the_fly_indexing to compute these
              plots and deliver these to the parser.

              Specific case studies have been explored by the experiment team of
              Area B of the FAIRmat project to realize and implement such mapping.

              The first case study uses the H5OINA format and the pyxem/orix library.
              As orix is a Python library, the coloring is performed by the em_om parser.

              The second case study uses MTex and its EBSD color coding model.
              As MTex is a Matlab tool, an intermediate format is written from MTex
              first which stores these pieces of information. The parser then pulls
              these data from the intermediate Matlab-agnostic representation and
              supplements the file with missing pieces of information as it is
              required by NXem_ebsd.

              The third case study shows how a generic set of Kikuchi pattern
              can be loaded with the em_om parser. The pattern are loaded directly
              from a ZIP file and mapped to an simulation image section for now.

              The fourth case study uses the DREAM.3D package which provides an own
              set of EBSD data post-processing procedures. DREAM.3D documents the
              processing steps with a pipeline file which is stored inside DREAM.3D
              output files. In this case study, the parser reads the DREAM.3D file
              and maps data relevant from the perspective of NXem_ebsd plus adds
              relevant IPF color maps as they were computed by DREAM.3D.
              Given that in this case the origin of the data is the DREAM.3D file
              again provenance is kept and more details can be followed upon when
              resolving origin.

              These examples offer a first set of suggestions on how to make EBSD
              data injectable into research data management system using schemes
              which themselves are agnostic to the specific RDMS and interoperable.
              Steps of collecting the raw data and post-processing these with custom
              scripts like MTex or commercial tools so far are mainly undocumented.
              The limitation is that a program which consumes results or dump files
              from these tools may not have necessarily all the sufficient information
              available to check if the injected orientation data and color models
              are matching the conventions which a user or automated system has
              injected into an electronic lab notebook from which currently the em_om
              parser collects the conventions and stores them into this NXem_ebsd instance.
              The immediate benefit of the here presented NXem_ebsd concept though
              is that the conventions and reference frame definitions are expected
              in an ELN-agnostic representation to make NXem_ebsd a generally useful
              data scheme for EBSD.

              Ideally, the em_om parser would load convention-compliant EBSD data
              and use subsequently a community library to transcode/convert orientation
              conventions and parameterized orientation values. Thereafter, convention-
              compliant default plot(s) could be created that would be truely interoperable.

              However, given the variety of post-processing tools available surplus
              the fact that these are not usually executed along standardized
              post-processing workflows which perform exactly the same algorithmic steps,
              this is currently not a practically implementable option. Indeed, first
              developers who wish to implement this would first have to create a library
              for performing such tasks, mapping generally between conventions,
              i.e. map and rotate coordinate systems at the parser level.

              The unfortunate situation in EBSD is that due to historical reasons
              and competitive strategies, different players in the field have
              implemented (slightly) different approaches each of which misses
              some part of a complete workflow description which is behind EBSD analyses:
              Sample preparation, measurement, indexing, post-processing, paper...

              The here exemplified default plot do not so far apply relevant rotations
              but takes the orientation values as they come from the origin and using
              coloring them as they come. It is thus the scientists responsibility to
              enter and check if the respective dataset is rotation-conventions-wise
              consistent and fit for a particular task.

              Ideally, with all conventions defined it can be possible to develop
              a converter which rotates the input data. This application definition
              does not assume this and users should be aware of this limitation.

              The key point is that the conventions however are captured and this is
              the most important step to the development of such a generic transcoder
              for creating interoperable EBSD datasets.

              Currently the conventions remain in the mind or manual lab book of the
              respective scientists or technicians instead of getting stored and
              communicated with research papers that are written based on
              specific dataset, i.e. database entries.

              The default gridded representation of the data should not be
              misinterpreted as the only possible way how EBSD data and OIM
              maps can be created!

              Indeed, the most general case is that patterns are collected for
              scan points. The scan generator of an electron microscope is instructed
              to steer the beam in such a way across the specimen surface that the
              beam illuminates certain positions for a certain amount time (usually
              equally-spaced and spending about the same amount of time at each
              position).

              Therefore, scan positions can be due to such regular flight plans and
              represent sampling on lines, line stacks, rectangular regions-of-
              interests, but also could instruct spiral, random, or adaptive scans
              instead of tessellations with square or hexagonal pixels.

              The majority of EBSD maps is though is reporting results for a regular
              grid (square, hexagon). What matters though in terms of damage induced
              by the electron beam and signal quality is the real electron dose
              history, i.e. for how long the beam exposed which location of the
              specimen. Especially when electron charging occurs (i.e. an excess
              amount of charge accumulates due to e.g. poor conducting away of this
              charge or an improper mounting, too high dose, etc. such details are
              relevant.

              Specifically, the default visualization is an inverse pole-figure (IPF)
              map with the usual RGB color coding. Different strategies and
              normalization schemes are in use to define such color coding.

              Finally, we should mention that each ipf_map represents data for
              scan points indexed as one phase. The alias/name of this phase should
              be stored in phase_name, the phase_identifier give an ID which must
              not be zero as this value is reserved for non-indexed / null model scan
              points.

                For each stereographic standard triangle (SST), i.e. a rendering of
                the fundamental zone of the crystal-symmetry-reduced orientation space SO3,
                it is possible to define a color model which assigns each point in
                the fundamental zone a color.
                Different mapping models are in use and implement (slightly) different
                scaling relations. Differences are which base colors of the RGB
                color model are placed in which extremal position of the SST
                and where the white point is located. For further details see:

                Details are implementation-specific and not standardized yet.
                Given that the SST has a complicated geometry, it cannot yet be
                visualized using tools like H5Web, which is why for now the em_om

          This application definition also enables to describe a workflow where several
          EBSD datasets are not only documented but also correlated based on time,
          position (spatial), or both (spatiotemporal).

          Spatial correlations between repetitively characterized regions-of-interests
          are typically correlated using image registration and alignment algorithms.
          For this typically so-called landmarks are used. These can be grains with
          a very large size or specific shape, i.e. grains which are qualitatively
          different enough to be used as a guide how images are shifted relative to
          one another. Other commonly used landmarks are fiducial marks which are
          milled into the specimen surface using focus-ion beam milling and/or various
          types of indentation methods.

          As far as the same physical region-of-interest is just measured several times,
          the additional issue of the depth increment is not a concern. However, correct
          assumptions for the depth increment, amount of material removed along the milling
          direction is relevant for accurate and precise three-dimensional (serial-sectioning)
          correlations. For these studies it can be tricky though to assume or estimate
          useful depth increments. Different strategies have been proposed like
          calibrations, wedged-shaped landmarks and computer simulation assisted
          assumption making.

          Despite the use of landmarks, there are many practical issues which make the
          processing of correlations imprecise and inaccurate. Among these are drift
          and shift of the specimen, instabilities of the holder, the beam, irrespective
          of the source of the drift, charging effects, here specifically causing local
          image distortions and rotations which may require special processing algorithms
          to reduce such imprecisions.

          Time correlations face all of the above-mentioned issues surplus the challenge
          that specific experimental protocols have to be used to ensure the material state
          is observed at specific physical time. The example of quasi in-situ characterization
          of crystal growth phenomena, a common topic in engineering or modern catalysis research
          makes it necessary to consider that e.g. the target value for the desired annealing
          temperature is not just gauged based on macroscopic arguments but considers
          that transient effects take place. Heating or quenching a sample might thus might
          not have been executed under conditions in the interaction volume as they are
          documented and/or assumed.

          These issue cause that correlations have an error margin as to how accurately
          respective datasets were not only just synced based on the geometry of the
          region-of-interests and the time markers but also to asssure which physical
          conditions the specimen experienced over the course of the measurements.

          The fourth example of the em_om reference implementation explores the use of the
          correlation group with a serial-sectioning datasets that was collected by the
          classical Inconel 100 dataset collected by M. D. Uchic and colleagues
          (M. Groeber M, Haley BK, Uchic MD, Dimiduk DM, Ghosh S 3d reconstruction and
          characterization of polycrystalline microstructures using a fib-sem system data set.
          Mater Charac 2006, 57 259–273. 10.1016/j.matchar.2006.01.019M).

          This dataset was specifically relevant in driving forward the implementation
          of the DREAM.3D software. DREAM.3D is an open-source software project for
          post-processing and reconstructing, i.e. correlating sets of orientation
          microscopy data foremost spatially. One focus of the software is the
          (post-)processing of EBSD datasets. Another cutting edge tool with similar
          scope but a commercial solution by Bruker is QUBE which was developed by
          P. Konijnenberg and coworkers.

          Conceptually, software like DREAM.3D supports users with creating linear
          workflows of post-processing tasks. Workflows can be instructed via the
          graphical user interface or via so-called pipeline processing via command line
          calls. DREAM.3D is especially useful because its internal system documents all
          input, output, and parameter of the processing steps. This makes DREAM.3D a
          good candidate to interface with tools like em_om parser. Specifically, DREAM.3D
          documents numerical results via a customized HDF5 file format called DREAM3D.
          Workflow steps and settings are stored as nested dictionaries in JSON syntax
          inside a supplementary JSON file or alongside the data in the DREAM3D file.
          DREAM.3D has a few hundred algorithms implemented. These are called filters
          in DREAM.3D terminology.

          Users configure a workflow which instructs DREAM.3D to send the data through
          a chain of predefined and configured filters. Given that for each analysis
          the filter is documented via its version tags surplus its parameter and setting
          via a controlled vocabulary, interpreting the content of a DREAM3D HDF5 file
          is possible in an automated manner using a parser. This makes DREAM.3D analyses
          repeatable and self-descriptive. A key limitation though is that most frequently
          the initial set of input data come from commercial files like ANG.
          This missing link between the provenance of these input files, their associated
          creation as electron microscope session, is also what NXem_ebsd solves.

          Nevertheless, as this can be solved with e.g. NXem_ebsd we are convinced that
          the DREAM.3D and the em_om parser can work productively together to realize
          RDMS-agnostic parsing of serial-section analyses.

          The internal documentation of the DREAM.3D workflow also simplifies the
          provenance tracking represented by an instance of NXem_ebsd as not every
          intermediate results has to be stored. Therefore, the fourth example
          focuses on the key result obtained from DREAM.3D - the reconstructed
          and aligned three-dimensional orientation map.

          Usually, this result is the starting point for further post-processing
          and characterization of structural features. As here orientation microscopy
          is insofar scale invariant using DREAM.3D, NXem_ebsd, and em_om should
          be useful for different characterization methods, such as EBSD, Transmission
          Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD), Automated Crystal Orientation Mapping (ACOM),
          Nanobeam Electron Diffraction (using commercial systems like NanoMegas ASTAR)
          or open-source implementations of these techniques (such as via pyxem/orix).

          The result of orientation microscopy methods are maps of local orientation
          and thermodynamic phase (crystal structure) pieces of information. Virtually
          all post-processing of such results for structural features includes again
          a workflow of steps which are covered though by the NXms partner application
          definition. The respective source of the data in an instance of NXms can
          again be a link or reference to an instance of NXem_ebsd to complete the
          chain of provenance.
