**Status**:

  *base class* (contribution), extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for describing isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space. ...

      Base class for describing isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.

      Iso-contouring algorithms such as Marching Cubes and others are frequently
      used to segment d-dimensional regions at crossings of a threshold value,
      the so-called isovalue.

      In Computational Materials Science phase-field methods are frequently used.
      Phase-field variables are discretized frequently using regular grids.

      Isocontour algorithms are often used in such context to pinpoint the
      locations of microstructural features from this implicit phase-field-
      variable-value-based description.

      One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
      for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed-matter physicists,
      and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field (and other)
      simulation data can take advantage of NeXus base class to improve
      interoperability.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality of the description.
