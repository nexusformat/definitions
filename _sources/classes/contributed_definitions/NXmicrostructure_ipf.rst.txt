        Inverse pole figure mapping.

        Instances named phase0 should by definition refer to the null phase notIndexed.
        Inspect the definition of :ref:`NXphase` and its field  phase_id
        for further details.

        Details about possible regridding and associated interpolation
        during the computation of the IPF map visualization can be stored
        using the input_grid, output_grid, and interpolation fields.

        The main purpose of this map is to offer a normalized default representation
        of the IPF map for consumption by a research data management system (RDMS).

          Inverse pole figure color code for each map coordinate.

          Different types of AXISNAME dimensional scale axes are found in practice. A few examples:

          * No scaling, e.g. pixel position values like 0, 1, 2, 3 pixel.
            Pixels on the map can be distinguished but that map is disconnected from
            any sample surface context and eventually physical scaling
          * Scaling but no offset, e.g. calibrated pixel position 0., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 micron.
            Pixels on the map can be compared for their distance to obtain e.g. size of features
            but the position of the map relative to the e.g. the sample surface is unclear.
            For IPF maps this is the most frequently reported situation.
          * Scaling and offset, which resolves also the absolute position of the map in
            relation to the sample surface. This is useful information for stitching multiple
            mappings together and other processing where precise and accurate
            position data are relevant e.g. for correlative materials characterization.

          Three types of dimensional constraints for maps are possible:

          * (n_x, 3), a one-dimensional map,
            typically used for coarse sampling and crystal size statistics.
          * (n_y, n_x, 3), a two-dimensional map,
            the most frequently found reported
          * (n_z, n_y, n_x, 3), a three-dimensional map,
            these are commonly generated using computational methods,
            or in cases multiple EBSD maps have been stitched/reconstructed
            into a three-dimensional map.

        The color code which maps color to orientation in the fundamental zone.

        For each stereographic standard triangle (SST), i.e. a rendering of the
        fundamental zone of the crystal-symmetry-reduced orientation space
        SO3, it is possible to define a color model which assigns a color to each
        point in the fundamental zone.

        Different mapping models are used. These implement (slightly) different
        scaling relations. Differences exist across representations of tech partners.

        Differences are which base colors of the RGB color model are placed in
        which extremal position of the SST and where the white point is located.

        For further details see:

        * [G. Nolze et al.](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576716012942)
        * [S. Patala et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2012.04.002).

        Details are implementation-specific and not standardized yet.
