**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for a region-of-interest (ROI) bound by geometric primitives. ...

      Base class for a region-of-interest (ROI) bound by geometric primitives.

      So-called region-of-interest(s) (ROIs) are typically used to describe a
      region in space (and time) where an observation is made or for which
      a computer simulation is performed with given boundary conditions.

**Symbols**:

  .. collapse:: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays. ...

      The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
      Use :ref:`NXcg_primitive` and :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` classes to
      define explicitly the reference frame in which the primitives are
      defined.
