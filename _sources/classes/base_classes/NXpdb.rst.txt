**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  A NeXus transliteration of a PDB file, to be validated only as a PDB
  rather than in NeXus.

  Use :ref:`NXpdb` to incorporate the information in an arbitrary
  PDB into a NeXus file.

  The main suggestion is to use this as a container
  class for a PDB entry to describe a sample in NXsample,
  but it may be more appropriate to place this higher in the
  hierarchy, say in NXentry.

  The structure has to follow the structure of a PDB
  with each PDB data block mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb,
  using a lowercase version of the data block name as the name
  of the NeXus group, each PDB category in that data block
  mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb and with each PDB column
  mapped to a NeXus field.  Each column in a looped PDB category
  should always be presented as a 1-dimensional array.  The columns 
  in an unlooped PDB category should be presented as scalar values.  
  If a PDB category specifies particular units for columns, the same 
  units should beused for the corresponding fields.

  A PDB entry is unambigous when all information is carried as text.
  All text data should be presented as quoted strings, with the quote
  marks except for the null values "." or "?"

  For clarity in NXpdb form, numeric data may be presented using the
  numeric types specified in the mmCIF dictionary.  In that case,
  if a PDB null value, "." or "?", is contained in a numeric column, the
  IEEE nan should be used for "?" and the IEEE inf should be used for ".".

  An arbitrary DDL2 CIF file can be represented in NeXus using NXpdb.  
  However, if save frames are required, an NXpdb_class  attribute with the
  value "CBF_cbfsf" is required for each NeXus group representing a save
  frame.  NXpdb attributes are not required for other CIF components,
  but may be used to provide internal documentation.

  The nesting of NXpdb groups and datasets that correspond to a CIF with
  two categories and one saveframe, including the NXpdb_class attribues is::

  	(datablock1):NXpdb
  	   @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfdb
  	   (category1):NXpdb
  	     @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
  	      (column_name1):[...]
  	      (column_name2):[...]
  	      (column_name3):[...]
  	      ...
  	   (category2):NXpdb
  	      @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
  	      (column_name4):[...]
  	      (column_name5):[...]
  	      (column_name6):[...]
  	      ...
  	   (saveframe1):NXpdb
  	      @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfsf
  	      (category3):NXpdb
  	        @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
  	        (column_name7):[...]
  	        (column_name8):[...]
  	        (column_name9):[...]
  	         ...
  	      ...
  	   ...

  For example, a PDB entry that begins::

  	data_1YVA
  	#
  	 _entry.id   1YVA
  	#
  	_audit_conform.dict_name       mmcif_pdbx.dic
  	_audit_conform.dict_version    5.279
  	_audit_conform.dict_location   http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic
  	#
  	loop_
  	_database_2.database_id
  	_database_2.database_code
  	PDB   1YVA
  	RCSB  RCSB031959
  	WWPDB D_1000031959
  	#

  would produce::

  	sample:NXsample
  	   1yva:NXpdb
  	     entry:NXpdb
  		 id:"1YVA"
  	     audit_conform:NXpdb
  		 dict_name:"mmcif_pdbx.dic"
  		 dict_version:"5.279"
  		 dict_location:"http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic"
  	     database_2:NXpdb
  		 database_id:["PDB","RCSB","WWPDB"]
  		 database_code:["1YVA","RCSB031959","D_1000031959"]

  another example is the following excerpt from pdb entry 9ins, giving the sequences
  of the two chains::

  	loop_
  	_entity_poly.entity_id
  	_entity_poly.nstd_linkage
  	_entity_poly.nstd_monomer
  	_entity_poly.pdbx_seq_one_letter_code 
  	_entity_poly.pdbx_seq_one_letter_code_can
  	_entity_poly.type
  	1 no no GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN polypeptide(L)
  	2 no no FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA
  	polypeptide(L)

  which converts to::

  	entity_poly:NXpdb
  	  @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
  	  entity_id:["1", "2"]
  	  nstd_linkage:["no", "no"]
  	  nstd_monomer:["no", "no"]
  	  pdbx_seq_one_letter_code:["GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN","FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA"]
  	  pdbx_seq_one_letter_code_can:["GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN","FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA"]
  	  type:["polypeptide(L)", "polypeptide(L)"]
