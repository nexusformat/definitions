        Figure-of-merit to determine the goodness of fit, i.e., how well the fit model (i.e., the set of peaks and backgrounds)
        fits the measured observations.

        This value (which is a single number) is often used to guide adjustments to the
        fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.

          The difference between the observed data (``input_dependent``) and the predicted
          fit values (``fit_sum``). A lower magnitude of residuals indicates a better fit.

          Relative sensitivity for this peak, to be used for quantification in
          an NXprocess.

          As an example, in X-ray spectroscopy could depend on the energy scale
          (see position), the ionization cross section, and the element probed.

          Relative area of this peak compared to other peaks.

          The relative area can simply be derived by dividing the total_area by the
          total area of all peaks or by a more complicated method (e.g., by
          additionally dividing by the relative sensitivity factors). Details shall
          be given in `global_fit_function`.

        and intensities) of the peak fit.

          Often, if the peaks and fit backgrounds are defined independently (i.e, with their own
          parameter sets), the resulting global fit is a function of the form
          :math:`model = peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3).`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the
          set of parameters for one peak/background.

  .. _/NXfit/error_function-group:

  **error_function**: (optional) :ref:`NXfit_function` 

    Function used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.

    .. index:: description (field)

    **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` :ref:`⤆ </NXfit_function/description-field>`

      .. collapse:: Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fittin ...

          Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
          Examples:

          - least squares
          - nonlinear least squares
          - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)
          - linear regression
          - Bayesian linear regression

    .. _/NXfit/error_function/formula_description-field:

    .. index:: formula_description (field)

    **formula_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` :ref:`⤆ </NXfit_function/formula_description-field>`

      .. collapse:: For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the ``globa ...

          For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the ``global_fit_function`` given above.
          As an example, for a least squares algorithm on independent components, the formula of the ``error_function``
          would be :math:`LLS(peak_1(p_1) + peak_2(p_2) + backgr(p_3))`, where each :math:`p_i` describes the set
          of parameters for one peak/background. In this case, the ``formula_description`` can be expressed as
          :math:`min(\chi^2)`, where :math:`\chi^2` is the sum of squared residuals between the model and the
          observed data:
          :math:`min(\chi^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \left( \text{peak}_1(p_1, x_i) + \text{peak}_2(p_2, x_i) + \text{backgr}(p_3, x_i) \right) \right)^2`

          It is however also possible to supply more involved formulas (e.g., in the case of constrained fits).
