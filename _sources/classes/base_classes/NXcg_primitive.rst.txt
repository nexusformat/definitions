**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of primitives in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of primitives in Euclidean space.

      Primitives must neither be degenerated nor self-intersect.
      Individual primitives can differ in their properties (e.g. size, shape, rotation).

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality of the embedding space.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of members.

        The dimensionality of the primitive set with value up to d.

  .. _/NXcg_primitive/cardinality-field:

  .. index:: cardinality (field)

  **cardinality**: (optional) :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

  .. _/NXcg_primitive/index_offset-field:

  .. index:: index_offset (field)

  **index_offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Integer offset whereby the identifier of the first member ...

        Integer offset whereby the identifier of the first member
        of the set differs from zero.

        Indices can be used as identifiers and thus names of instances.

        Identifiers can be defined either implicitly or explicitly.
        For implicit indexing identifiers are defined on the interval
        :math:`[index\_offset, index\_offset + c - 1]`.

        Therefore, implicit identifier are completely defined by the value of
        index_offset and cardinality. For example if identifier run from
        -2 to 3 the value for index_offset is -2.

        For explicit indexing the field identifier has to be used.
        Fortran-/Matlab- and C-/Python-style indexing have specific implicit
        identifier conventions where index_offset is 1 and 0 respectively.

        Do the primitives define a geodesic mesh or not.

        A geodesic surface mesh is a triangulated surface mesh with metadata which
        can be used as an approximation to describe the surface of a sphere.
        Triangulation of spheres are commonly used in Materials Science
        for quantifying texture of materials, i.e. the relative rotation of
        crystals to sample directions.

        For additional details or an introduction into the topic of geodesic meshes
        see (from which specifically the section on subdivision schemes is relevant).

        * `E. S. Popko and C. J. Kitrick <https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003134114>`_

        Earth scientists have specific demands and different views about what should
        be included in such a base class, given that nested geodesic meshes are a key
        component of climate modelling software. For now we propose to use this
        base class as a container for organizing data related to geodesic meshes.

        Specifically an instance of this base class should detail the rule set how
        e.g. a geodesic (surface) mesh was instantiated as there are many
        possibilities to do so.
