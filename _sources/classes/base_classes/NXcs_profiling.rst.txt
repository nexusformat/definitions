      Computer science description for performance and profiling data of an application.

      Performance monitoring and benchmarking of software is a task where questions
      can be asked at various levels of detail. In general, there are three main
      contributions to performance:

      * Hardware capabilities and configuration
      * Software configuration and capabilities
      * Dynamic effects of the system in operation and the system working together
        with eventually multiple computers, especially when these have to exchange
        information across a network and these are used usually by multiple users.

      At the most basic level users may wish to document how long e.g. a data
      analysis with a scientific software, i.e. an app took.

      A frequent idea is here to answer practical questions like how critical is the
      effect on the workflow of the scientists, i.e. is the analysis possible in
      a few seconds or would it take days if I were to run this analysis on a
      comparable machine?
      For this more qualitative performance monitoring, mainly the order of
      magnitude is relevant, as well as how this was achieved using parallelization
      (i.e. reporting the number of CPU and GPU resources used, the number of
      processes and threads configured, and providing basic details about the computer).

      At more advanced levels benchmarks may go as deep as detailed temporal tracking
      of individual processor instructions, their relation to other instructions, the
      state of call stacks; in short eventually the entire app execution history
      and hardware state history. Such analyses are mainly used for performance
      optimization, i.e. by software and hardware developers as well as for
      tracking bugs. Specialized software exists which documents such performance
      data in specifically-formatted event log files or databases.

      This base class cannot and should not replace these specific solutions for now.
      Instead, the intention of the base class is to serve scientists at the
      basic level to enable simple monitoring of performance data and log profiling
      data of key algorithmic steps or parts of computational workflows, so that
      these pieces of information can guide users which order of magnitude differences
      should be expected or not.

      Developers of application definitions should add additional fields and
      references to e.g. more detailed performance data to which they wish to link
      the metadata in this base class.

        Wall-clock time how long the app execution took. This may be in principle
        end_time minus start_time; however usage of eventually more precise timers
        may warrant to use a finer temporal discretization,
        and thus demands a more precise record of the wall-clock time.

  .. _/NXcs_profiling/max_processes-field:

  .. index:: max_processes (field)

  **max_processes**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

        The number of nominal processes that the app invoked at runtime.

        The main idea behind this field e.g. for apps which use e.g. MPI
        (Message Passing Interface) parallelization is to communicate
        how many processes were used.

        For sequentially running apps number_of_processes and number_of_threads
        is one. If the app exclusively uses GPU parallelization, number_of_gpus
        can be larger than one. If no GPU is used, number_of_gpus is zero,
        even though the hardware may have GPUs installed.

        Specifically here the maximum number of threads used for the
        high-level threading library used (e.g. OMP_NUM_THREADS), posix.
