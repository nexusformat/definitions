**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  A monitor of incident beam data.

  It is similar to the :ref:`NXdata` groups containing
  monitor data and its associated dimension scale, e.g. time_of_flight or
  wavelength in pulsed neutron instruments. However, it may also include
  integrals, or scalar monitor counts, which are often used in both in both
  pulsed and steady-state instrumentation.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXmonitor@default-attribute:

  .. index:: default (file attribute)

  **@default**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    .. index:: plotting

    Declares which child group contains a path leading 
    to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

    It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
    to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
    See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
    for a summary of the discussion.

    Proportion of incident beam sampled by the monitor (0<x<1)

  .. _/NXmonitor/count_time-field:

  .. index:: count_time (field)

  **count_time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`}

    Elapsed actual counting time, can be an array of size ``np``
    when scanning. This is not the difference of the calendar time
    but the time the instrument was really counting, without
    pauses or times lost due beam unavailability

  .. _/NXmonitor/depends_on-field:

  .. index:: depends_on (field)

  **depends_on**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
    to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
    is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
    field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
    string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
    NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

    The reference plane of the monitor contains the surface of the detector that faces the source
    and is the entry point of the beam. The reference point of the monitor in the x and y axis is
    its centre on this surface. The reference plane is orthogonal to the the z axis and the
    reference point on this z axis is where they intersect.

  .. _/NXmonitor/integral_log-group:

  **integral_log**: (optional) :ref:`NXlog`

    Time variation of monitor counts

  .. _/NXmonitor/GEOMETRY-group:

  **GEOMETRY**: (optional) :ref:`NXgeometry`


    .. index:: deprecated


    **DEPRECATED**: Use the field `depends_on` and :ref:`NXtransformations` to position the monitor and NXoff_geometry to describe its shape instead

    Geometry of the monitor

  .. _/NXmonitor/OFF_GEOMETRY-group:

  **OFF_GEOMETRY**: (optional) :ref:`NXoff_geometry`

    This group describes the shape of the beam line component

  .. _/NXmonitor/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations`

    This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
    and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
    the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
    other component groups.
