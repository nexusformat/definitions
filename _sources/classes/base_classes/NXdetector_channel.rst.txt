  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Description and metadata for a single channel from a multi-channel detector. ...

      Description and metadata for a single channel from a multi-channel detector.

      Given an :ref:`NXdata` group linked as part of an NXdetector group that has an axis with named channels (see the
      example in :ref:`NXdata </NXdata@default_slice-attribute>`), the NXdetector will have a series of NXdetector_channel groups, one for each
      channel, named CHANNELNAME_channel.

      Example, given these axes in the NXdata group::

        @axes = ["image_id", "channel", ".", "."]

      And this list of channels in the NXdata group::

        channel = ["threshold_1", "threshold_2", "difference"]

      The NXdetector group would have three NXdetector_channel groups::

        detector:NXdetector
          ...
          threshold_1_channel:NXdetector_channel
            threshold_energy = float
            flatfield = float[i, j]
            pixel_mask = uint[i, j]
            flatfield_applied = bool
            pixel_mask_applied = bool
          threshold_2_channel:NXdetector_channel
            threshold_energy = float
            flatfield = float[i, j]
            pixel_mask = uint[i, j]
            flatfield_applied = bool
            pixel_mask_applied = bool
          difference_channel:NXdetector_channel
            threshold_energy = float[2]

**Symbols**:

      These symbols will be used below to illustrate the coordination of the rank and sizes of datasets and the 
      preferred ordering of the dimensions. Each of these are optional (so the rank of the datasets 
      will vary according to the situation) and the general ordering principle is slowest to fastest.
      The type of each dimension should follow the order of scan points, detector output (e.g. pixels),
      then time-of-flight (i.e. spectroscopy, spectrometry). Note that the output of a detector is not limited 
      to single values (0D), lists (1D) and images (2D), but three or higher dimensional arrays can be produced 
      by a detector at each trigger.

  **dataRank**: Rank of the ``data`` field associated with this detector

  **nP**: number of scan points

  **i**: number of detector pixels in the slowest direction

  **j**: number of detector pixels in the second slowest direction

  **k**: number of detector pixels in the third slowest direction

**Groups cited**:
  none

        Errors of the flat field correction data.
        The form flatfield_error is deprecated.

        True when the pixel mask correction has been applied in the
        electronics, false otherwise.

        Custom pixel mask for this channel. May include nP as the first dimension for
        masks that vary for each scan point.

  .. _/NXdetector_channel/saturation_value-field:

  .. index:: saturation_value (field)

  **saturation_value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: The value at which the detector goes into saturation. ...

        The value at which the detector goes into saturation.
        Especially common to CCD detectors, the data
        is known to be invalid above this value.

        For example, given a saturation_value and an underload_value, the valid
        pixels are those less than or equal to the saturation_value and greater
        than or equal to the underload_value.

        The precise type should match the type of the data.

  .. _/NXdetector_channel/underload_value-field:

  .. index:: underload_value (field)

  **underload_value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: The lowest value at which pixels for this detector would be reasonably ...

        The lowest value at which pixels for this detector would be reasonably
        measured. The data is known to be invalid below this value.

        For example, given a saturation_value and an underload_value, the valid
        pixels are those less than or equal to the saturation_value and greater
        than or equal to the underload_value.

        The precise type should match the type of the data.
