  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms.

      This class can also be used to describe rectangles or squares, irrespective
      whether these are axis-aligned or not. The class represents different
      access and description levels to embrace applied scientists and computational
      geometry experts with their different views:

      * The simplest case is the communication of dimensions aka the size of a
        region of interest in the 2D plane. In this case, communicating the
        alignment with axes is maybe not as relevant as it is to report the area
        of the ROI.
      * In other cases the extent of the parallelogram is relevant though.
      * Finally, in CAD models it should be possible to specify the polygons
        which the parallelograms represent with exact numerical details.

      Parallelograms are important geometrical primitives as their usage for
      describing many scanning experiments shows where typically parallelogram-shaped
      ROIs are scanned across the surface of a sample.

      The term parallelogram will be used throughout this base class thus including
      the important special cases rectangle, square, 2D box, axis-aligned bounding box
      (AABB), or optimal bounding box (OBB) as analogous 2D variants to their 3D
      counterparts. See :ref:`NXcg_hexahedron` for the generalization in 3D.

      An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in computational science
      and simulation codes to represent a rectangle whose edges are aligned with the
      axes of a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees AABBs are important data
      objects for executing time- as well as space-efficient queries
      of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.

      An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best, i.e.
      most tightly fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
      rotated. Other than in 3D dimensions, the rotation caliper method offers
      a rigorous approach to compute an optimal bounding box to a point set in 2D.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of parallelograms.

        Only to be used if is_rectangle is present. In this case, this field
        describes whether parallelograms are rectangles whose primary edges
        are parallel to the axes of the coordinate system.

    Combined storage of all parallelograms.

    Individual storage of each parallelogram.
