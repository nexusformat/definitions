      In general, an alpha complex is a not necessarily connected or not necessarily pure complex,
      i.e. singular faces may exist. The number of cells, faces, and edges depends on how a specific
      alpha complex is filtered for lower-dimensional simplices. The fields is_regularized and
      regularization can be used to provide details about regularization procedures.
