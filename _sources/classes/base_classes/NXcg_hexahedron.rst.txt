**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of hexahedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of hexahedra in Euclidean space.

      This class can also be used to describe cuboids or cubes, axis-aligned or not.
      The class represents different access and description levels to offer both
      applied scientists and computational geometry experts an approach whereby
      different specific views can be implemented using the same base class:

      * In the simplest case experimentalists may use this base class to describe
        the dimensions or size of a specimen. In this case the alignment with axes
        is not relevant as eventually only the volume of the specimen is of interest.
      * In many cases, take for example an experiment where a specimen was cut out
        from a specifically deformed piece of material, the orientation of the
        specimen's edges with the experiment coordinate system is of high relevance.
        Examples include knowledge about the specimen edge, whether it is
        parallel to the rolling, the transverse, or the normal direction.
      * While the above-mentioned use cases are sufficient to pinpoint the sample
        within a known laboratory/experiment coordinate system, these descriptions
        are not detailed enough to specify e.g. a CAD model of the specimen.
      * Therefore, groups and fields for an additional, computational-geometry-
        based view of hexahedra is offered to serve additional computational
        tasks: storage-oriented simple views or detailed topological/graph-based
        descriptions.

      Hexahedra are important geometrical primitives, which are among the most
      frequently used elements in finite element meshing/modeling.

      As a specialization of the :ref:`NXcg_primitive` base class hexahedra
      are assumed non-degenerated, closed, and built of polygons that are
      not self-intersecting.

      The term hexahedra will be used throughout this base class but includes
      the special cases cuboid, cube, box, axis-aligned bounding box (AABB),
      and optimal bounding box (OBB).

      An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in computational science
      and simulation codes to represent a cuboid whose edges are aligned with the
      base vectors of a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees, these data
      objects are important for making time- as well as space-efficient queries
      of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.

      An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best
      tightly fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general, such boxes are
      rotated. Exact and substantially faster in practice approximate algorithms
      exist to compute optimal or near optimal bounding boxes for sets of points.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of hexahedra.

        Qualifier that is useful in cases when one edge is longer than all other
        edges of the hexahedra. Often the term length is associated with the
        assumption that one edge is parallel to an axis of the coordinate system.

        Qualifier often used to describe the extent of an object in the horizontal
        direction assuming a specific coordinate system.

        For the sake of explicitness quantities like length, width, and height
        should not be reported without specifying also the assumed reference frame.

        Specifies if the hexahedra represent cuboids or cubes eventually rotated
        ones but at least not too exotic six-faced polyhedra.

  .. _/NXcg_hexahedron/is_axis_aligned-field:

  .. index:: is_axis_aligned (field)

  **is_axis_aligned**: (optional) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c])

        whether hexahedra are boxes whose primary edges are parallel to the
        axes of the coordinate system.
