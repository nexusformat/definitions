**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXaperture`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide. ...

      A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.

      This describes cryostat windows and other possible influences for ellipsometry
      measurements.

      For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
      etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
      direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
      window) (looking from the sample).

      The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
      measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
      a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
      in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
      performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference measurements should be
      considered as a separate experiment (with a separate NeXus file), and
      the reference data shall be :ref:`linked <Design-Links>` in
      ``reference_data_link``.

      The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
      beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
      defined by the 'depends_on' field.

          Describe when (before or after the main measurement + time
          stamp in 'date') and how the window effects have been
          corrected, i.e. either mathematically or by performing a
          reference measurement. In the latter case, provide the link to
          to the reference data in ``reference_data_file``.

          :ref:`External link <Design-Links>` to the data field in the NeXus file which describes                   
          the reference data if a reference measurement for window correction 
          was performed.

          Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on the same sample,
          using the same conditions as for the actual measurement, with
          and, if possible, without windows. It should have been conducted as close in time
          to the actual measurement as possible.

          Ideally, the link uses the relative path with respect to the actual
          NeXus file.
