**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXcg_primitive`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra.

      Among hexahedral elements, tetrahedral elements are one of the most
      frequently used geometric primitive for meshing and describing volumetric
      objects in continuum-field simulations.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of tetrahedra.
