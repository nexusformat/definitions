      Contains data structures of an experimental optical setup (i.e., multiple
      transfer matrix tables).   These data structures are used to relate physical
      properties of two beams (NXbeam) which have one common optical component
      (NXcomponent) (one specific transfer matrix).
      One of these beams is an input beam and the other one is an output beam.

      The data describes the change of beam properties, e.g. the intensity of a
      beam is reduced because the transmission coefficient of the beam device is
      lower than 1.

**Symbols**:

  Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.

  **N_variables**: Length of the array associated to the data type.

**Groups cited**:
  none

        Select which type of data was recorded, for example aperture and
        focal length.
        It is possible to have multiple selections. This selection defines
        how many columns (N_variables) are stored in the data array.
        N in the name, is the index number in which order the given
        property is listed.

        Any of these values:

          * ``aperture``

          * ``focal length``

          * ``orientation``

          * ``jones matrix``

        Please list in this array the column and row names used in your actual data.
        That is in the case of aperture ['diameter'] or focal length ['focal_length_value']
        and for orientation matrix ['OM1', 'OM2', 'OM3'] or for jones matrix

        Contains the datastructure which relates beam properties of an
        input and output beam as result of the input beam interaction
        with the beam device.

        Transfer matrix relationship between N input beams and M output beams.
        It contains a table with the relevant matrices to be used for different
        transmitted properties (such as polarization, intensity, phase).

        Data structure for all transfermatrices of a beam device in a setup.
        For each combination of N input and M output beams and for L physical
        concept (i.e. beam intensity), one matrix can be defined.

        In this way, the transfer matrix table has the dimension NxM.

        For each entry, in this transfer matrix, there are L formalisms.
        Each formalism has the dimension math:`dim(L_i)xdim(L_i)`,
        whereby math:`L_i` is the specific physical concept (Intensity, polarization, direction).

        A beamsplitter with two input laser beams can have a total of
        four transfermatrices (2 Input x 2 Output).

        The dimension of the transfer matrix depends on the parameters.
        Examples are:
        1x1 for intensity/power
        2x2 for jones formalism
        3x3 for direction
