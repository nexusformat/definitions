**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class to store state and (meta)data of events for electron microscopy. ...

      Base class to store state and (meta)data of events for electron microscopy.

      Event-related (meta)data, typically measured datasets like images and spectra.
      To avoid repetitively storing static instrument-related metadata,
      the dynamic (meta)data that typically changes for each image and spectrum
      is split from the static (meta)data.

      Which temporal granularity is adequate to log events depends on the situation and
      research question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers
      the most flexible way to cater for both experiments with controlled electron
      beams in a real microscope or the simulation of such experiments or
      individual aspects of such experiments.

      Electron microscopes are dynamic. Scientists often report that microscopes
      *perform differently* across sessions. That *they* perform differently from
      one day or another. In some cases, root causes for performance differences
      are unclear. Users of the instrument may consider such conditions impractical,
      or *too poor*, and thus abort their session. Alternatively, users may try to
      bring the microscope into a state where conditions are considered better
      or of whatever high enough quality for starting or continuing the measurement.

      In all these use cases it is useful to have a mechanism whereby time-dependent
      data of the instrument state can be stored and documented in an representation
      that facilitates interoperability. This is the idea behind this base class.

      :ref:`NXem_event_data` represents an instance to describe and serialize flexibly
      whatever is considered a time interval during which the instrument is
      considered stable enough for allowing any working on tasks with it.
      Examples of such tasks are the collecting of data (images and spectra) or
      the calibrating the instrument or individual of its components. Users may wish to take
      only a single scan or image and complete their session thereafter.
      Alternatively, users are working for much longer time at the instrument,
      perform recalibrations in between and take several scans (of different
      ROIs on the specimen), or they explore the state of the microscope for
      service or maintenance tasks.

      :ref:`NXem_event_data` serves the harmonization and documentation of these cases:

      * Firstly, via a header section whose purpose is to contextualize
        and identify the event instance in time.
      * Secondly, via a data and metadata section where individual data
        collections can be stored in a standardized representation.

      We are aware of the fact that given the variety how an electron microscope
      is used, there is a need for a flexible and adaptive documentation system.
      At the same time we are also convinced though that just because one has
      different requirements for some specific aspect under the umbrella of settings
      to an electron microscope, this does not necessarily warrant that one has to
      cook up an own data schema.

      Instead, the electron microscopy community should work towards reusing schema
      components as frequently as possible. This will enable that there is at all
      not only a value of harmonizing electron microscopy research content but also
      there is a technical possibility to build services around such harmonized data.

      Arguably it is oftentimes tricky to specify a clear time interval when the
      microscope is *stable enough*. Take for instance the acquisition of an image
      or a stack of spectra. Having to deal with instabilities is a common theme in
      electron microscopy practice. Numerical protocols can be used during data
      post-processing to correct for some of the instabilities.
      A few exemplar references provide an overview on the subject:

      * `C. Ophus et al. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.12.002>`_
      * `B. Berkels et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.12.016>`_
      * `L. Jones et al. <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40679-015-0008-4>`_

      For specific simulation purposes, mainly in an effort to digitally repeat or simulate
      the experiment (digital twin), it is tempting to consider dynamics of the instrument,
      implemented as time-dependent functional descriptions of e.g. lens excitations,
      beam shape functions, trajectories of groups of electrons and ions, or detector noise models.
      This also warrants to document the time-dependent details of individual components
      of the microscope via the here implemented class :ref:`NXem_event_data`.

        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
        when the snapshot time interval started.

        If users wish to specify an interval of time that the snapshot should represent
        during which the instrument was stable and configured using specific settings and
        calibrations, the start_time is the start (left bound of the time interval) while
        the end_time specifies the end (right bound) of the time interval.

        This field may also be used for storing additional information
        about the event for which there is at the moment no other place.

        In the long run such free-text field description should be avoided as
        it is difficult to machine-interpret. Instead, an enumeration should
        be used.
