NXcollection

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line.

  Use :ref:`NXcollection` to gather together any set of terms.
  The original suggestion is to use this as a container 
  class for the description of a beamline.

  For NeXus validation, :ref:`NXcollection` will always generate 
  a warning since it is always an optional group.  
  Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
  an :ref:`NXcollection` group will not be validated.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  none
