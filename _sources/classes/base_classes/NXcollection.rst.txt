      An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line.

      Use :ref:`NXcollection` to gather together any set of terms.
      The original suggestion is to use this as a container 
      class for the description of a beamline.

      For NeXus validation, :ref:`NXcollection` will always generate 
      a warning since it is always an optional group.  
      Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
      an :ref:`NXcollection` group will not be validated.

      .. admonition:: NXcollection content is not validated.

         :ref:`NXcollection` is and will always be for unvalidated content.

         Any and all content within a :ref:`NXcollection` group specified by
         an application definition cannot be validated.

         It is suggested to use a :ref:`NXparameters` group for similar
         content which should be validated.
