  .. collapse:: Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS). ...

      Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).

      Instances of ``NXcoordinate_system`` can be used to describe coordinate systems
      other than the default `NeXus coordinate system <https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#the-nexus-coordinate-system>`_.

      Whenever possible, all instances of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
      should be used at the top-level (i.e, directly below ``NXentry``)
      within an application definition or within a NeXus file.

      ``NXcoordinate_system`` can be part of the transformations chain
      using :ref:`NXtransformations`, where it acts as a linear
      change-of-basis transformation (using a 3x3 matrix with the basis
      vectors ``x``, `y``, and ``z`` as columns).

      Any group that has an optional ``depends_on`` field or any field
      that has an optional ``depends_on`` attribute has a fallback when
      ``depends_on`` is not provided. The fallback behavior involves
      traversing up the hierarchy until the first ancestor that contains one
      and only one ``NXcoordinate_system`` group is found. If such an ancestor
      exists, its coordinate system applies. If none is found or more than
      one instance of ``NXcoordinate_system`` is found at the same level,
      then the current coordinate system is not defined with respect to
      anything else. As an example, if there is only one ``NXcoordinate_system``
      called "my_coordinate_system" defined directly under ``NXentry``, each
      optional ``depends_on`` field/attribute that is not defined
      automatically defaults to ``depends_on=my_coordinate_system``.

      How many groups of type ``NXcoordinate_system`` should be used in
      an application definition?

      * 0; if there is no instance of ``NXcoordinate_system`` across the
        entire tree, you can use ``depends_on="."`` to state that this
        transformation depends on the default
        `NeXus coordinate system <https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#the-nexus-coordinate-system>`_
        (which is the same as the one used by `McStas <https://mcstas.org/>`_).

        For the sake of clarity, even in this case it is better
        to be explicit and consistent for every other coordinate system definition
        to support users with interpreting the content and logic behind
        every instance of the tree.

        The default NeXus coordinate system (i.e., the McStas coordinate
        system) can be expressed as follows:

        .. code-block::

          mcstas@NXcoordinate_system
              x = [1, 0, 0]
              y = [0, 1, 0]
              z = [0, 0, 1]
              @y_direction = "opposite to gravity"
              @z_direction = "direction of the primary beam"

        Note that this assumes that the direction of the beam is not defined in the ``NXbeam`` instance.

      * 1; if only one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` is defined, it should be
        placed as high up in the tree hierarchy (ideally right below an
        instance of NXentry) of the application definition tree as possible.
        This coordinate system shall be named such that it is clear how this
        coordinate system is typically referred to in a community. For the
        NeXus McStas coordinate system, it is advised to call it ``mcstas``
        for the sake of improved clarity.

        If this is the case, it is assumed that this ``NXcoordinate_system``
        overwrites the NeXus default McStas coordinate system, i.e. users
        can thereby conveniently and explicitly specify the
        coordinate system that they wish to use.

        This case has the advantage that it is explicit and offers no
        ambiguities. However, in reality typically multiple coordinate
        systems have to be mastered especially for complex multi-signal
        modality experiments.

        If this case is realized, the best practice is that in every
        case where this coordinate system should be referred to the respective
        group has a ``depends_on`` field, to clearly indicate which 
        specific coordinate systems is referred to.

      * 2 and more; as soon as more than one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
        is specified somewhere in the tree, different interpretations are
        possible as to which of these coordinate systems
        apply or take preference.
        While these ambiguities should be avoided if possible, the
        opportunity for multiples instances enables to have coordinate
        system conventions that are specific for some part of the NeXus
        tree. This is especially useful for deep groups where
        multiple scientific methods are combined or cases where having a
        definition of global conversion tables how to convert between
        representations in different coordinate systems is not desired
        or available for now.

        To resolve the possible ambiguities which specific coordinate systems 
        in an :ref:`NXtransformations` train is referred to, it is even more
        important to use the ``depends_on`` field in groups and the ``depends_on``
        attribute in NXtransformations to refer to one of the ``NXcoordinate_system``
        instances.

        In the case of two or more instances of ``NXcoordinate_system`` it
        is advised to specify the relationship between the two coordinate
        systems by using the :ref:`NXtransformations` group within
        ``NXcoordinate_system``.

      In any case, users are encouraged to write explicit and clean
      ``depends_on`` fields in all groups that encode information for which
      the interpretation of coordinate systems and transformations is relevant.
      If these ``depends_on`` instances are not provided or no instance of
      ``NX_coordinate_system`` exists in the upper part of the hierarchy,
      the application definition is considered underconstrained. Note that this
      is the case for all files that were created before ``NXcoordinate_system``
      was added.
