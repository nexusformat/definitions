**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXprocess`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class to report on the characterization of an area or volume of material. ...

      Base class to report on the characterization of an area or volume of material.

      This area or volume of material is considered a region-of-interest (ROI).

      This base class should be used when the characterization was achieved by
      processing data from experiment or computer simulations into models of
      the microstructure of the material and the properties of the material or its
      crystal defects within this ROI. Microstructural features is a narrow synonym
      for these crystal defects.

      This base class can also be used to store data and metadata of the
      representation of the ROI, i.e. its discretization and shape.

      Methods from computational geometry are typically used for
      defining a discretization of the area and volume.

      Do not confuse this base class with :ref:`NXregion`. The purpose
      of the :ref:`NXregion` base class is to document data access i.e.
      I/O pattern on arrays. Therefore, concepts from :ref:`NXregion` operate
      in data space rather than in real or simulated real space.
