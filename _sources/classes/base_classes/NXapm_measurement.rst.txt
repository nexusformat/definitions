**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for collecting a run with a real or a simulated atom probe or field-i ...

      Base class for collecting a run with a real or a simulated atom probe or field-ion microscope.

      The term run is understood as an exact synonym for session, i.e. the usage of a real or simulated
      tomograph or microscope for a certain amount of time during which one characterizes a single specimen.

      Research workflows for experiments and simulations of atom probe and related field-evaporation
      evolve continuously and become increasingly connected with other methods used for material
      characterization specifically electron microscopy. A few examples in this direction are:

      * `T. Kelly et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205>`_
      * `C. Fleischmann et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_
      * `W. Windl et al. <https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozad067.294>`_
      * `C. Freysoldt et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.176801>`_
      * `G. da Costa et al. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54169-2>`_

      The majority of atom probe research is performed using the so-called Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) instruments
      from AMETEK/Cameca. In addition, several research groups have built their own instruments and shared different
      aspects of the technical specifications and approaches including how these groups apply data processing e.g.:

      * `M. Monajem et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927622003397>`_
      * `P. Stender et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621013982>`_
      * `I. Dimkou et al. <https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozac051>`_

      to name but a few.

        A statement whether the measurement completed successfully, or was aborted.

        Any of these values: ``success`` | ``aborted``

        Statement about the quality of the measurement.

        The value can be extracted from the CAnalysis.CResults.fQuality
        field of a CamecaRoot ROOT file.
