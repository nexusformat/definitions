**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class for reporting a set of images representing specializations of NXdata. ...

      Base class for reporting a set of images representing specializations of NXdata.

      The most commonly used scanning methods are supported. That is one-,
      two-, three-dimensional ROIs discretized using regular Euclidean tilings.

      Colloquially, an image is understood as a discretized representation of intensity distribution
      detected or simulated for some ROI. When discretized with regular Euclidean tilings, the terms
      pixel and voxel identify the smallest discretization unit. In this case, pixel and voxel are polygonal
      or polyhedral unit cells respectively of the underlying tiling of the ROI within the reference space.
      For all other tilings e.g. non-equispaced, the shape and size of pixel and voxel differs. Using the term
      image point is eventually more appropriate when working with such tilings.

      Therefore, all docstrings in this base class refer to points. Points are considered
      exact synonyms for pixel and voxel, which are terms used for regular tilings.

      Point coordinates identify the location of the barycenter.

      For images in reciprocal space in practice, complex numbers are encoded via some formatted pair of real values.
      Typically, fast algorithms for computing Fourier transformations (FFT) are used to encode images in reciprocal
      (frequency) space. FFT libraries are used for implementing the key functionalities of these mathematical operations.
      Different libraries use different representations and encoding of the images.
      Details can be found in the respective sections of the typical FFT libraries documentations:

      * `FFTW by M. Frigo and S. G. Johnson <https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Tutorial.html#Tutorial>`_
      * `Intel MKL by the Intel Co. <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2024-2/fourier-transform-functions.html>`_
      * `cuFFT by the NVidia Co. <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufft/index.html>`_
      * `NFFT by the TU Chemnitz group <https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/>`_ for non-equispaced computations

      Users are strongly advised to inspect carefully which specific conventions their library uses
      to enable storing and modifying the implementation of their code such that the serialized
      representations as they are detailed here for NeXus match.

      It is often the case that several images are combined using processing. In this case,
      the number of images which are combined into collections is not necessarily the same
      for each collection. The NXimage base class addresses this logical distinction
      through the notation of indices_image and indices_group concepts.
      That is indices_image are always counting from offset in increments of one
      as each image is its own entity. By contrast, a group may contain no, or several images.
      Consequently, indices_group are not required to be contiguous.

      Classically, images depict objects in real space. Such usage of NXimage essentially is equivalent to
      storing pictures. For this purpose the image_1d, image_2d, or image_3d NXdata instances respectively
      should be used such that all their axes axis_i, axis_j, axis_k are constrained to NeXus Unit Category NX_LENGTH.

      Imaging modes in electron microscopy are typically more versatile, specifically for use cases
      in scanning transmission electron microscopy, so-called 4DSTEM. In this case, one two-dimensional
      diffraction image is taken for each point that gets scanned in real space. Consequently,
      image_3d and image_4d NXdata instances should be used for these cases with axis_k and axis_m
      respectively of NeXus Unit Category NX_LENGTH and axis_i and axis_j respectively of
      NeXus Unit Category NX_WAVENUMBER or NX_UNITLESS.
