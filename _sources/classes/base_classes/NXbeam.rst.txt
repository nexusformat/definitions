**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Properties of the neutron or X-ray beam at a given location. ...

      Properties of the neutron or X-ray beam at a given location.

      This group is intended to be referenced
      by beamline component groups within the :ref:`NXinstrument` group or by the :ref:`NXsample` group. This group is
      especially valuable in storing the results of instrument simulations in which it is useful
      to specify the beam profile, time distribution etc. at each beamline component. Otherwise,
      its most likely use is in the :ref:`NXsample` group in which it defines the results of the neutron
      scattering by the sample, e.g., energy transfer, polarizations. Finally, There are cases where the beam is
      considered as a beamline component and this group may be defined as a subgroup directly inside
      :ref:`NXinstrument`, in which case it is recommended that the position of the beam is specified by an 
      :ref:`NXtransformations` group, unless the beam is at the origin (which is the sample).

      Note that incident_wavelength and related fields can be a scalar values or arrays, depending on the use case.
      To support these use cases, the explicit dimensionality of these fields is not specified, but it can be inferred
      by the presense of and shape of accompanying fields, such as incident_wavelength_weights for a polychromatic beam.

**Symbols**:

  These symbols coordinate datasets with the same shape.

  **nP**: Number of scan points.

  **m**: Number of channels in the incident beam spectrum, if known

  **c**: Number of moments representing beam divergence (x, y, xy, etc.)

**Groups cited**:

        .. index:: plotting

        Declares which child group contains a path leading 
        to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

        It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
        to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
        See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
        for a summary of the discussion.

        In the case of a monochromatic beam this is the scalar
        wavelength.

        Several other use cases are permitted, depending on the
        presence or absence of other incident_wavelength_X
        fields.

        In the case of a polychromatic beam this is an array of
        length **m** of wavelengths, with the relative weights
        in ``incident_wavelength_weights``.

        In the case of a monochromatic beam that varies shot-
        to-shot, this is an array of wavelengths, one for each
        recorded shot. Here, ``incident_wavelength_weights`` and
        incident_wavelength_spread are not set.

        In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
        shot, this is an array of length **m** with the relative
        weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D array.

        In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
        shot and where the channels also vary, this is a 2D array
        of dimensions **nP** by **m** (slow to fast) with the
        relative weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D
        array.

        Note, :ref:`variants <Design-Variants>` are a good way
        to represent several of these use cases in a single dataset,
        e.g. if a calibrated, single-value wavelength value is
        available along with the original spectrum from which it
        was calibrated.

        Beam crossfire in degrees parallel to the laboratory X axis

        The dimension **c** is a series of moments of that represent
        the standard uncertainty (e.s.d.) of the directions of
        of the beam. The first and second moments are in the XZ and YZ
        planes around the mean source beam direction, respectively.

    .. collapse:: Polarization vector on entering beamline component using Stokes notation ...

        Polarization vector on entering beamline component using Stokes notation

        The Stokes parameters are four components labelled I,Q,U,V or S_0,S_1,S_2,S_3.
        These are defined with the standard Nexus coordinate frame unless it is
        overridden by an NXtransformations field pointed to by a depends_on attribute.
        The last component, describing the circular polarization state, is positive
        for a right-hand circular state - that is the electric field vector rotates
        clockwise at the sample and over time when observed from the source.

        I (S_0) is the beam intensity (often normalized to 1). Q, U, and V scale 
        linearly with the total degree of polarization, and indicate the relative
        magnitudes of the pure linear and circular orientation contributions.

        Q (S_1) is linearly polarized along the x axis (Q > 0) or y axis (Q < 0).

        U (S_2) is linearly polarized along the x==y axis (U > 0) or the
        -x==y axis (U < 0).

        V (S_3) is circularly polarized. V > 0 when the electric field vector rotates
        clockwise at the sample with respect to time when observed from the source; 
        V < 0 indicates the opposite rotation.

        The NeXus coordinate system defines the Z axis to be along the nominal beam
        direction. This is the same as the McStas coordinate system (see :ref:`Design-CoordinateSystem`).

        direction can be provided using this depends_on field that contains the path
        to a NXtransformations group. This could represent redirection of the beam,
