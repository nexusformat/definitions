  .. collapse:: Application definition for stress and strain analysis of crystalline material de ...

      Application definition for stress and strain analysis of crystalline material defined by the `EASI-STRESS consortium <https://easi-stress.eu>`_.

      When a crystal is loaded (applied or residual stress) its crystallographic parameters change.

      Stress and strain analysis calculates deformation (strain) and the associated force (stress)
      from diffraction data.

      This application definition essentially standardizes the result of diffraction pattern analysis
      from different types of diffraction experiments for the purpose of stress and strain analysis.
      The analysis is typically some form of diffraction peak indexing and fitting.
      The experiments are for example

      - energy-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction
      - angular-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction
      - angular-dispersive neutron powder diffraction
      - time-of-flight (TOF) neutron powder diffraction.

      In addition, the application definition guarantees that the information about instrumental setups, measurement conditions, and data analysis workflows are described.
      This ensures not only the reproducability and tracability of the measured data, but also the metadata. Since not all participating beamlines or instruments can provide an input to all the NeXus fields listed in this application definition, not all of them are "required".

      However, when possible and technically feasible, the instrument using the NXstress application definition is expected to provide the type of information outlined below.

      Sample and detector positions can be defined with :ref:`NXtransformations`. If you don't specify the direction of gravity
      and the direction of the beam then the standard NeXus Coordinate System is used.

      It is highly recommended that when certain parameters or values are the same for all the measurements (acquistions) in the same
      file, they are stored only in one location and then linked in the other instances. For example, if during an acquisition all

      instrumental parameters but one stay the same and only the sample table moves in one direction (e.g. Xtranslation), then all the
      static instrumental parameters should be saved just once (e.g. in just one NXentry or in a *Shared_Information group*) and their
      values linked to every *instrument group* under all the other acquisitions. The value for the variable that changes, Xtranslation
      in this example, is suggested to be saved only at every instrument group under each acquistion but not in the *Shared_Information group*.

      It is not always necessary to link each field. In case all the fields with an entire group are the same, the entire group can be linked.

**Symbols**:


  **n_X**: Number of diffractogram channels.

  **n_D**: Number of diffractograms. For example the number of energy-dispersive detectors or the number of azimuthal sections in an area detector.

  **n_Peaks**: Number of reflections.

  **x_Unit**: Diffractogram X units.

  **y_Unit**: Diffractogram Y units.

  **c_Unit**: Converted diffractogram X units (could be the same as *x_Unit*).

  **n_Temp**: number of temperatures

  **n_sField**: number of values in applied stress field

  **nP**: number of scan points (only present in scanning measurements)

              This is the distance to the previous component in the
              instrument; most often the sample. The usage depends on the
              nature of the detector: Most often it is the distance of the
              detector assembly. But there are irregular detectors. In this
              case the distance must be specified for each detector pixel.

              Note, it is recommended to use NXtransformations instead.

              This field can be two things:

              1. For a pixel detector it provides the nominal wavelength
              for which the detector has been calibrated.

              2. For other detectors this field has to be seen together with
              the efficiency field above.
              For some detectors, the efficiency is wavelength dependent.
              Thus this field provides the wavelength axis for the efficiency field.
              In this use case, the efficiency and wavelength arrays must
              have the same dimensionality.

            * Only recognized element symbols may be used.
            * Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of '1' may be omitted.
            * A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element symbol + count).
            * Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the multiplier for the 
              group must follow the closing parentheses. That is, all element and group 
              multipliers are assumed to be printed as subscripted numbers.
            * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to their chemical 
              structure, the order of the elements within any group or moiety depends on 
              whether or not carbon is present.
            * If carbon is present, the order should be:

              - C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of their symbol. 
              - If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in alphabetic order of their symbol.

          .. collapse:: Diffraction background profile. Required when background parameter field ...

              Diffraction background profile. Required when background parameter fields are present.
              Some example values with equations are shown below:

                  - ``manual`` : No equations nor variables needed to describe this background.
                  - ``linear`` : \ :math:`\small background= A0 + A1 \cdot x`
                  - ``5-degree polynomial`` : \ :math:`\small background= A0 + A1 \cdot x + A2 \cdot \mathrm{x}^{2} + A3 \cdot \mathrm{x}^{3} + A4 \cdot \mathrm{x}^{4} + A5 \cdot \mathrm{x}^{5}`
                  - ``shape function plus polynomial`` : A shape function is not a mathematical function, it contains a manual background obtained from a fit and a polynomial part. This allows to adapt and modify the fit for subsequent measurements in the same measurement campaign. The function describing it is the following: \ :math:`\small background= as + b \cdot SHAPE(x-o)` Where SHAPE is the name of the variable used to describe the background value at the position x. x can be e.g. the scattering angle \ :math:`2\theta` in degrees.
