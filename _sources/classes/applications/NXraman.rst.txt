**Description**:

  .. collapse:: An application definition for Raman spectroscopy experiments. ...

      An application definition for Raman spectroscopy experiments.

      This application definition supports a wide range of Raman spectroscopy experiments.
      These may be as simple as acquiring a single Raman spectrum from spontaneous Raman
      scattering, or as complex as Raman imaging with a Raman spectrometer. The scope also
      includes surface- and tip-enhanced Raman techniques, X-ray Raman scattering, resonant
      Raman scattering, and multidimensional Raman spectra collected under varying conditions
      such as temperature, pressure, or electric field.

      The application definition comprises two main components:

      1. Structures defined in NXoptical_spectroscopy:
      * Instrument configuration and data calibration
      * Sensors monitoring sample or beam conditions

      2. Structures specified and extended in NXraman:
      * Description of the experiment type
      * Metadata and configuration of the optical setup (e.g., source, monochromator, detector, waveplate, lens)
      * Detailed description of beam properties and their interaction with the sample
      * Sample-specific information

      Information on Raman spectroscopy are provided in:
