      Application definition for real or simulated atom probe and field-ion microscopy experiments.

      Atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy are methods for characterizing materials
      through induced controlled extraction of individual atoms as ions and molecular ions from
      a sharp needle-shaped specimen.

      Offering isotopic and nanometer-scale resolution, atom probe data enable quantification of
      local chemical composition and computing of volumetric reconstructions which are models for
      the atomic architecture of the small specimen volume analyzed. These reconstructions provide
      input for characterization of atomic segregation at crystal defects. The term microstructural features
      is considered as a narrow synonym for crystal defects.

      The aim of the NXapm application definition is to provide a general yet specific enough
      solution to serialize artifacts for virtually all atom probe and field-ion microscopy experiments.

      Before summarizing the design of the base classes and the parts of the NXapm application definition,
      it is worthwhile to recall and distinguish concepts that are related to atom extraction
      events and the molecular ions that are frequently generated by the sequence of events:

      * An atom probe instrument uses laser or voltage pulsing events to trigger ion extraction events.
      * These ions are accelerated in an electric field towards a position-sensitive detector system.
        Physical events and corresponding signal on this detector is triggered by an ion hitting the detector.
        Some of these events are not necessarily caused by or directly correlated with an identifiable pulsing event.
      * Note that only a part the specimen volume can be measured and finite detection efficiency means that
        not all atoms in the measured volume will be detected. Neutral atoms can escape detection. Some ions
        escape detection because they hit into walls of the analysis_chamber.

       Raw data are typically processed as follows:

      * Detector pulses and their timing are processed and discriminated into signal events of different quality levels.
        High quality events might be considered in further processing to identify the corresponding molecular ion
        and its original position in the reconstructed volume.
      * Signal calibration and filtering steps are applied to convert raw time-of-flight data to calibrated
        mass-to-charge state ratio values and obtain calibrated impact positions on the detector.
      * Ranging and identifying an ion that corresponds to each detector event.
        Isotopic abundance and theoretical models inform these ranging algorithms.
      * Finally, such selected ion impact positions and iontypes are used to compute a reconstructed volume of
        the specimen using backprojection algorithms. In effect, an atom probe measurement is a combination of
        a data acquisition and a data analysis workflow.

      Not only in AMETEK/Cameca's APSuite/IVAS software, which the majority of atom probers use, these concepts
      are well distinguished. However, the algorithms used to transform correlations between pulses and physical
      events into actual events, the so-called detector hits of ions, is a proprietary one. This algorithm is also
      referred to as the hit finding algorithm.

      Due to this practical inaccessibility of details, virtually all atom probe studies currently use a reporting
      schema where the course of the specimen evaporation is documented such that quantities are a function of
      evaporation_id i.e. actual event/ion, i.e. after having the hit finding algorithm and correlations applied.
      That is the evaporation_id values take the role of an implicit time and course of the experiment given that
      ion extraction physically is a sequential process.

      This application definition includes fields that the atom probe community has decided to represent best practices
      for reporting atom probe measurements. Exemplar mapping tables are provided for documents that reported these
      best practices to translate technical term into concepts of the NXapm application definition.

      *The NeXus application definition NXapm defines a hierarchical data model with ten building blocks:*

      The data model represents a tree of concepts. The tree is constructed from groups of concepts representing
      the branches, together with fields and attributes representing leaves. NXapm is defined by composing and
      specializing base classes into the following ten categories:

      - The field ``definition`` specifies that the data schema is NXapm. In combination with
        administrative metadata such as the attribute ``NeXus_version`` provided by :ref:`NXroot` this
        specifies which version of NXapm the instance data in a NeXus/HDF5 file are compliant with.
      - The fields ``run_number``, ``experiment_alias``, ``experiment_description`` and
        the group ``userID`` provide concepts for storing organizational metadata that
        contextualize the work within the research workflow and humans involved in this.
      - The fields ``start_time``, ``end_time`` provide concepts for framing a temporal context for the research.
      - The groups ``citeID``, ``noteID`` provide concepts for adding contextual details such as citations or notes
        that are associated with the data, i.e. other artifacts that are deemed relevant when reporting about
        a measurement or simulation. These groups are useful when NXapm is used as a serialization format for
        technology-partner-agnostic archival of data and metadata that have been collected during a session with
        an atom probe instrument. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms that refer to an
        uninterrupted period of measurement. Resuming measurement on a specimen after an interruption is viewed
        as a new run and the new data should not be appended to the previous run, but written to either a new NXentry,
        or a new file. Removing the specimen from the instrument is an interruption. Changing evaporation conditions
        while the specimen is remains in the analysis_chamber and resuming thereafter the measurement
        is not considered as an interruption. It is a common strategy to probe the evaporation process for different
        instrument parameters. Each individual collection should then though be stored in an own NXapm_event_data
        group. Parking the specimen to the buffer_chamber and resuming the measurement at a later stage is an interruption.
        During a run, the microscope is used for a certain amount of time to characterize a single specimen.
      - The groups ``sample`` and ``specimen`` provide concepts for storing metadata about the sample and the specimen,
        i.e. the smaller part that was removed from the sample to be measured in the atom probe session.
        The term "tip" in the context of atom probe research is considered jargon.
        Specimen is an exact synonym for tip.
      - The field ``operation_mode`` and group ``measurement`` provides concepts that
        are useful for describing a measurement during a session with an atom probe or field-ion microscope.
        This includes the chain of events of data and metadata that were collected during such a session.
      - The group ``simulation`` provides concepts that are useful for describing a simulation of an
        atom extraction, ionization, and ion trajectory simulation. Combined with ``measurement``
        this provides a data schema for defining a digital twin of the instrument and its setup.
      - The groups ``consistent_rotations``, and ``NAMED_reference_frame`` provide concepts for
        reporting coordinate systems (frames of reference) and rotation conventions that clarify how data
        should be interpreted specifying the rotation of orientable objects in the microscope, its components,
        or of crystals and crystal defects in the material analyzed.
      - The group ``atom_probeID`` provides concepts for the computational workflows that were
        used to convert raw detector data into reconstructed ion positions and documentation of
        ranging definitions made.
      - The group ``profiling`` provides concepts for reporting computational details such as
        programs and libraries used, for documenting the libraries of virtual environments such as those used
        by conda or python virtual environment, including details about the computing hardware used, and
        documenting capabilities for performance analyses and benchmarking of the software or its parts.

      *Design choices:*

      Given that most atom probe instruments across the globe were built by AMETEK/Cameca and are delivered
      with the AP Suite/IVAS software there is some homogeneity in how a measurement is performed and which data
      artifacts and algorithms used for data processing. Complementary use of open-source software specifically for
      the reconstruction, ranging, and later data processing stages contributes to a landscape of multiple tools in use.
      Therefore, communication of atom probe research differs between user groups. This holds even more so true
      for the sub community in atom probe which study physical mechanisms involved during ionization to the point that
      here that almost each research work defines different simulation tools with different types of data artifacts.

      NXapm defines constraints on the existence and cardinality of concepts and its concept branches but seeks to
      offer a compromise. The key design pattern followed is that most branches are made optional or at most recommended
      but their child concepts are conditionally required. Thereby, NXapm can cover a variety of simple but also complex
      use cases. An example of this parent-optional-but-children-stronger-restricted design is the combination of the
      optional group ``measurement`` with its required child ``measurement/instrument``:
      Users which report simulations are not forced to document the instrument but users which have characterized
      a specimen are motivated to report about the instrument. They are though not  necessarily required to report all
      the details of the instruments' components because the design pattern is applied recursively.

      *NXapm distinguishes and stores instance data based on how long they remain unchanged:*

      ``measurement`` provides two groups ``measurement/instrument`` and ``measurement/eventID``.
      The first group is designed for storing metadata about the instrument that do not change over the course of the session.
      Examples are the name of the technology partner who built the microscope or whether a laser or voltage pulser
      and reflectron exists or not. The second group is designed for metadata and data that are collected during
      the session with the instrument. These, are stored as instances of ``measurement/eventID``,
      events that can be time-stamped individually.
      Each instance of a group ``measurement/eventID`` contains ``measurement/instrument`` whose purpose is to
      store those specific state and settings of the instrument that was present during the collection of the event.
      Thereby, changing conditions such as campaigns with different target detection rate can be stored.

      Noteworthy, such an approach of the atom probe detecting groups of events and storing these as groups has also
      been in use in the proprietary software via CamecaRoot, a set of customized data structures and file formats that use
      the CernRoot library. By virtue of design this reduces unnecessary repetition of metadata stored in the first group.

      ``atom_probeID`` offer classes for the each task relevant task in the data processing pipeline that converts raw detector
      event data to calibrated mass-to-charge-state-ratio values and hit_position on the detector. These include
      ``initial_specimen``, and ``final_specimen`` locations for storing images of the specimen prior/after the measurement as
      considered best practice by AMETEK/Cameca, ``raw_data`` for delay-line timing data, ``hit_finding`` for details of the
      hit finding algorithm, ``hit_spatial_filtering`` a process that filters hits of too low quality and those laying outside the about
      to be computed reconstruction volume. Furthermore, group ``voltage_and_bowl`` offers a place for documenting calibrations
      and processing nonlinearities. Group ``mass_to_charge_conversion`` is used to document the mass calibration and the
      conversion from time-of-flight to mass-to-charge-state-ratio values.

      Finally, the groups ``reconstruction`` and ``ranging`` were designed to match and document the classical approaches how
      from all the previous sources of input one can compute a reconstructed volume, and apply peak fitting routines on the
      mass-to-charge-state-ratio histogram to label ions, i.e. range them for their isotopic identity.
      Group ``atom_probeID/reconstruction/naive_discretization`` offers a standardized way to report simple
      three-dimensional histograms. Group ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID`` and its
      complementing group ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID/charge_state_analysis``
      solves the issue that the ranging definitions in classical file formats are not reported for always for their isotopic identity
      and charge state. The field ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/iontypes`` provides a place for
      storing a compact representation of the results of each ranging definition made at the level of each ion.

      *The compatibility of NXapm and NXem:**

      The design of NXapm mirrors that of :ref:`NXem`. This was an intentional choice to support the increasingly stronger connection between
      these two materials characterization methods, especially in light of recent advances in the direct coupling of atom probe and
      transmission electron microscopes and scanning transmission electron microscopes.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_ht**: Number of hit qualities, the so-called hit types, distinguished.

  **n_dld**: Number of delay-line-detector (DLD) wires of the detector.

  **n_bins**: Number of bins used in the mass-to-charge-state-ratio spectrum.

  **p**: Number of pulses collected in between start_time and end_time resolved by an instance of :ref:`NXapm_event_data`. If this is not defined, p is the number of ions included in the reconstructed volume if the application definition is used to store results of an already reconstructed dataset.

  **p_out**: Number of pulses returned by the hit_finding algorithm. Neither necessarily equal to p nor to n.

  **n**: Number of ions spatially filtered from results of the hit_finding algorithm from which an instance of a reconstructed volume has been generated. These ions get new identifier assigned in the process, the so-called evaporation_id. This identifier must not be confused with the pulse_id. This value is typically smaller than both p and p_out.

  **m_r**: Number of mass resolution values.

          The identifier whereby the experiment is referred to in the control software.

          It is common practice in atom probe research to refer to a measurement on a single
          specimen as a run. When working with AMETEK/Cameca instruments it is a common
          practice also to store all data associated with such a run in files whose name
          is composed from a prefix that details the type of instrument (e.g. R5076) followed
          by the run_number. These filenames are often used as the specimen_name or
          experiment_identifier. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms.

          For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen,
          or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the identifier which matches
          best conceptually to the LEAP run number.

          The field does not have to be required, if the information is recoverable
          in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case; provided these
          RHIT or HITS files respectively are stored alongside a data artifact.
          With NXapm the RHIT or HITS can be stored via NXnote in the
          hit_finding algorithm section.

          As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
          It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
          while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
          needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
          We follow this habit of most atom probe groups. Such interrupted runs
          should be stored as individual :ref:`NXentry` instances in one NeXus file.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_alias-field:

          Free-text description about the experiment.

          Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
          by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
          into the field.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` :ref:`⤆ </NXentry/start_time-field>`

      .. collapse:: ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information ...

          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          included when the atom probe session started. If the exact duration of
          the measurement is not relevant, start_time only should be used.

          The start_time is required in order to ensure that at least one point in time
          is provided for full temporal context to a measurement and simulation
          when writing instance data using NXapm. Otherwise, the instance data
          can not be sorted in order or even placed in a logical sequence to other
          steps of the research workflow, which would disallow using functionalities
          in research data management systems that rely on temporal context.

          Specifying start_time and end_time is useful for capturing more detailed
          bookkeeping of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with
          having both dates specified, it may not be possible to infer how long
          the experiment took or for how long data were collected.

          More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
          collected to compute this event chain during the experiment. For this
          purpose the :ref:`NXapm_event_data` instance should be used.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>` :ref:`⤆ </NXentry/end_time-field>`

          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included
          when the atom probe session ended.

          Writing the end_time can be a tricky in practice. If written at the start
          of the experiment, it can only be an estimate. If written at the end, there
          is the risk for having the computer crash or lose power. The absence of
          end_time should not be interpreted as that the experiment was aborted.
          Only, the field ``status`` should be used for communicating such abortion.

          What type of atom probe experiment is performed to inform research data management
          systems and allow filtering:

          * apt are experiments where the analysis_chamber has no imaging gas.
            Experiments with LEAP instruments are typically with this operation_mode.
          * fim are experiments where the analysis_chamber has an imaging gas,
            which should be specified with the atmosphere in the analysis_chamber group.
          * apt_fim should be used for combinations of the two imaging modes.
            Few experiments of this type have been performed, as it can be detrimental
            to LEAP systems (see `S. Katnagallu et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012381>`_).

            A collection of all programs and libraries which are considered relevant
            to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
            generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.

            Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
            instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
            also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific
            set of base classes, application definitions, and  contributed definitions

            which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_

          Description of the sample from which the specimen was prepared or
          site-specifically cut out using e.g. a focused-ion beam instrument.

          In NXapm, a measurement is performed on a specimen. Since APM specimens
          are very small, they are typically cut from a larger object with some
          scientific significance, which NXapm refers to as a sample.

            If the specimen does not contain many crystals average values
            might be an unreliable descriptor.

          A coordinate system. Multiple instances require unique names.

          Several Euclidean coordinate systems (CS) are used in the field of atom probe:

            a CS specifying a local coordinate system of the planet earth which
            identifies into which direction gravity is pointing such that
            the laboratory space CS can be rotated into this world CS.
          * The laboratory space;
            a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or
            a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the
            transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod
            has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.
            In summary, this CS is defined by the chassis of the instrument.
            Suggested name of the group ``laboratory_reference_frame``.
          * The specimen space;
            a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,
            whose z axis points towards the detector.
            Suggested name of the group ``specimen_reference_frame``.
          * The detector space;
            a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the
            detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.
            This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion
            positions.
            Suggested name of the group ``detector_reference_frame``.
          * The reconstruction space;
            a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.
            The orientation depends on the analysis software used.
          * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the
            flight path of individual ions might be defined.
            Suggested name of the group ``reconstruction_reference_frame``.

          To achieve unique names, the prefix "NAMED" should be replaced to
          with something derived from an alias for the coordinate system,
          or the value of the "alias" field.

          of NXcoordinate_system e.g. laboratory_reference_frame,
          reconstruction_reference_frame and so on and so forth.

          In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
          space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
          stack. This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
          within a predefined evaporation identifier interval. Typically, the set of
          ion evaporation sequence identifiers is grouped into chunks.

          For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
          is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
          the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.

          To avoid these ambiguities, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations` should be used.

            Document the control software that was used on the instrument with which raw data
            were collected.

            For almost all atom probe instruments, the recorded raw data and metadata follow
            proprietary semantics. Therefore, this group can currently often not be filled with
            more than the control software and some pointing to digital artifacts (e.g. proprietary files)
            that have been collected during the measurement in an effort to document as best as
            possible all steps of an analysis workflow.

            The physical quantities measured in an atom probe experiment are time-of-flight and
            tuples of arrival_time_pairs as a function of the event chain on the pulser.
            From these tuples, hits are computed in a process called hit_finding.

              At least the main software should be reported. If this is the only program
              to report name the group "program" and use its below fields program and
              version to detail the version used. E.g. program AP Suite, version 6.3

              It is recommended to report multiple programs though, i.e. also the libraries
              and dependencies of the software. In the case of AP Suite/IVAS this can be used
              to document the AP Suite GUI, LAS, CamecaRoot, and CernRoot versions.
              In this case always name the program groups program1, program2, ...
              with program one being AP Suite/IVAS.

              In the case of an open-source instrument, like P. Felfer's Oxcart or G. Schmitz's
              M-TAP instruments, also use program1, program2, ... with program1 representing
              the control software e.g. `M. Monajem and P. Felfer PYCCAPT <https://pyccapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
              Further instances (program2, ...) can be used to list the dependencies, the
              python virtual environment.

              Hit quality is an integer that specifies which category/type a hit was assigned to.
              This field lists the human-readable, possibly though proprietary types distinguished.
              The indices of this array are used in hit_quality to encode hit_quality for each
              pulse in a more efficient way than by repeating the string that is used for each
              type as it is provided in this field.

              As an example, assume two types, "golden" and "partial", are distinguished.
              If hit_quality_type stores the array "golden", "partial", the index 0
              in hit_quality identifies all those pulses of category "golden",
              while the index 1 in hit_quality identifies all of category "partial".

                The mass-resolving power (MRP) value

                `D. Larson et al. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-8721-0>`_ report Eq. D.8 in page 282:

                :math:`MRP = \frac{1}{2\delta t} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m}{n}\frac{1}{2eV}L}`,

                with :math:`\delta t` representing the timing imprecision, :math:`\frac{m}{n}` the mass-to-charge state ratio,
                :math:`e` the elementary charge, :math:`V` the potential difference, and :math:`L` the flight path length.

                Timing imprecision is caused by variations of flight path length and voltage,
                the fact that the precision of electronics is finite and a spread of the
                time-of-departure of individual ions is observed.
