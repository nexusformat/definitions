**Description**:

  .. collapse:: A general application definition of optical spectroscopy elements, which may ...

      A general application definition of optical spectroscopy elements, which may
      be used as a template to derive specialized optical spectroscopy experiments.

      Possible specializations are ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
      reflectivity/transmission spectroscopy.

      A general optical experiment consists of (i) a light/photon source, (ii) a sample,
      (iii) a detector.

      For any free-text descriptions, it is recommended to use English, as this ensures
      the most FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) representation of the information.

**Symbols**:

  Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.

  **N_spectrum**: Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured data.

  **N_measurements**: Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured data arrays). This is equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.

          An optional free-text description of the experiment.

          Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
          by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
          into this field.

          The reason is that such a free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
          The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn how far the
          current base classes need extension based on user feedback.

            reference frame to the default reference frame could be made. i.e.
            exchange of x and z coordinate, rotation of respective coordinates

            with respect to the beam directions.

            A beam centered description is the default and uses 4 angles(similar to XRD):

              - 2Theta (angle between the transmitted beam and the detection beam)

            Set of transformations, describing the relative orientation of different
            parts of the experiment (beams or sample). You may select one of the specified
            angles for incident and detection beam or sample, and then use polar and azimuthal
            angles to define the direction via spherical coordinates.
            This allows consistent definition between different coordinate system.
            You may refer to self defined coordinate system as well.

            If "angle_reference_frame = beam centered", then this coordinate system is used:
            McStas system (NeXus default)
            (https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#mcstas-and-nxgeometry-system)

            i.e. the z-coordinate math:`[0,0,1]` is along the incident beam direction and
            the x-coordinate math:`[1,0,0]` is in the horizontal plane. Hence, usually math:`[0,1,0]`
            is vertically oriented.

            If "angle_reference_frame = sample-normal centered", then this coordinate
            system is used
            z - math:`[0,0,1]` along sample surface normal
            x - math:`[1,0,0]` defined by sample surface projected incident beam.
            y - math:`[0,1,0]` in the sample surface, orthogonal to z and x.
            For this case, x may be ill defined, if the incident beam is perpendicular
            to the sample surface. In this case, use the beam centered description.
