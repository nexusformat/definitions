      Application definition for normalized representation of electron microscopy research.

      This application definition is a comprehensive, general description for the
      standardization of data and metadata collected using electron microscopy.

      NXem is designed to be used for documenting experiments or computer simulations in which
      controlled electron beams are used to study electron-beam matter interactions, to simulate this,
      to explore physical mechanisms and phenomena, or to characterize materials.

      *The NeXus application definition NXem defines a hierarchical data model with ten building blocks:*

      The data model represents a tree of concepts. The tree is constructed from groups of concepts
      representing the branches surplus fields and attributes representing leafs.

      *NXem an introduction for typical use cases in material characterization and simulation:*

      Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)
      Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
      Scanning Electron Microscopy combined a Focused-Ion Beam (SEM/FIB)

      *A deeper dive into the branches of NXem:*

      NXem is constructed from composing and specializing base classes into the following ten categories:

      - The field ``definition`` specifies that the data schema is NXem. In combination with
        administrative metadata such as the ``NeXus_version`` provided by :ref:`NXroot` this
        specifies which version of NXem the instance data in a NeXus/HDF5 file are compliant with.
      - The fields ``identifier_experiment``, ``experiment_alias``, ``experiment_description`` and
        the group ``userID`` provide concepts for storing organizational metadata that
        contextualize the work within the research workflow and humans involved in this.
      - The fields ``start_time``, ``end_time`` provide concepts for framing a temporal context for the research.
      - The groups ``citeID``, ``noteID`` provide concepts for adding contextual details such as citations
        that are associated with or notes, i.e. other artifacts that are deemed relevant when reporting about a measurement
        or simulation. These groups are useful when NXem is used as a serialization format for technology-partner-agnostic
        archival of data and metadata that have been collected during a session with an electron microscope or when a
        simulation was performed.
      - The group ``sampleID`` provides concepts for storing metadata about the sample that was
        characterized or simulated during the session.
      - The group ``measurement`` provides concepts that are useful for describing a measurement
        during a session with an electron microscope. This includes the chain of events of data and metadata that
        were collected during such a session.
      - The group``simulation`` provides concepts that are useful for describing a simulation of an
        electron beam that interacts with matter. Combined with ``measurement`` this provides a data schema
        for defining a digital twin of the microscope and its optical setup.
      - The groups ``consistent_rotations``, ``NAMED_reference_frame`` provide concepts for
        reporting coordinate systems (frames of reference) and rotation conventions that clarify how data
        should be interpreted specifying the rotation of orientable objects in the microscope, its components,
        or of crystals and crystal defects in the material analyzed. These metadata support interpretation for
        downstream or on-the-fly data analyses which electron microscopes typically nowadays perform
        during a session. Examples are the indexing of diffraction patterns, image analysis in general, or
        analyses of the chemical composition.
      - The group ``roiID`` provides concepts for reporting several domain- and technique-specific
        configuration parameter and results of data processing steps that were applied.
      - The group ``profiling`` provides concepts for reporting computational details such as
        programs and libraries used, for documenting the libraries of virtual environments such as those used
        by conda or python virtual environment, including details about the computing hardware used, and
        documenting capabilities for performance analyses and benchmarking of the software or its parts.

      *Design choices:*

      Specific details about how an electron microscope was used and eventually its configuration modified differ
      between user groups. This holds also true for computer simulations of electron-beam matter interaction.
      Different peer groups in different sub-domains in electron microscopy consider different data and metadata
      relevant. NXem defines constraints on the existence and cardinality of concepts and its concept branches
      but seeks to offer a compromise. The key design pattern followed is that most branches are made optional
      or at most recommended but their child concepts conditional required. Thereby, NXem can cover a variety
      of simple but also complex use cases. An example of this parent-optional-but-children-stronger-restricted design
      is the combination of the optional group ``measurement`` with its required child
      ``measurement/instrument``: Users which report simulations are not forced to document the instrument
      but users which have characterized a sample are motivated to report about the instrument. They are though not
      necessarily required to report all the details of the instruments' components because the design pattern is-used
      applied recursively.

      *Inclusive design, one schema for scanning, focused-ion beam, and transmission electron microscopes:*

      Contrary to many other proposals of a data schema for electron microscopy, NXem seeks to highlight the similarity
      of the three fundamental types of electron microscopes that are nowadays used most routinely in academia and
      industry: An electron microscope is a beamline that provides a controlled beam of electrons combined with eventually
      beams of other particles (ions) to investigate electron/ion(-beam) matter interaction.
      This design of per-particle-type concept branches is realized in the base classes ``NXebeam_column`` and ``NXibeam_column``.
      These provide concepts for reporting the technical components that are typically used for generating a controllable
      (and typically scanning) beam of particles such as electrons or ions.

      Focused-ion beam capabilities are modelled by adding an optional group ``measurement/instrument/ibeam_column``.
      We foresee that this design is beneficial also in the future when research should be documented where photon-electron
      interactions via an electron microscope are combined. The current proposal though does not include such a
      ``NXpbeam_column`` base class that could be used for photon-/light-beam, i.e. laser plus optical
      beam path descriptions and components.

      We acknowledge that scanning and transmission electron microscopes are different types of instruments that have distinct differences
      in the electron-optical setup and the components used. What remains the same from the perspective of an observer who monitors the
      experiment inside the electron-matter interaction volume, i.e. in, on, or close to the surface of the specimen is the imaginary split
      into an upper and a lower half-space. In the upper half-space a specific but eventually differently shaped electron beam illuminates
      the specimen when comparing a scanning with a transmission electron microscope. In the lower half-space the beam or particles exit
      the specimen or end up thermalized in thick specimens.

      *NXem distinguishes and stores instance data based on how long they remain unchanged:*

      ``measurement`` provides two groups ``measurement/instrument`` and ``measurement/eventID``.
      The first group is designed for storing metadata about the instrument which do not change over the course of the session. Examples are
      the name of the technology partner who built the microscope, the microscope's serial number, or the type of lenses mounted, etc.
      The second group is designed for metadata and data that are collected during the microscope session. For these, specializations of
      ``NXdata`` specifically ``NXimage`` and ``NXspectrum`` are provided. Each ``measurement/eventID`` event can be time-stamped
      individually. Each instance of a group ``measurement/eventID`` contains ``measurement/instrument`` whose purpose
      is to store those specific state and settings of the microscope that was present during the collection of the event.
      This includes lens settings, apertures used, aberrations, and other components, etc.
      By virtue of design this reduces unnecessary repetition of metadata stored in the first group like is often observed
      in image-based archival formats like TIFF, PNG, etc.

      *NXem offers domain-specific classes for standardized reporting of method-specific configurations, data processing, and results:*

      These include ``NXem_img`` for generic and specific imaging including diffraction, ``NXem_eds`` for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
      ``NXem_ebsd`` for electron backscatter diffraction, as well as ``NXem_eels`` for electron energy loss spectroscopy. These branches provide
      examples that proof how NeXus can be used for combining session-centric data storage with data processing. These examples are naturally
      incomplete but show at different levels of technical depth and breath how standardization can be useful even to report specifically formatted
      data representations like multi-dimensional plotting. Thereby, downstream processing using software for data analyses or research data
      management can take advantage of a standardized reporting rather than demanding for a zoo of parsers that interconvert
      between many representations.

      *NXem within the ecosystem of data schemata for electron microscopy:**

      We support the statement that substantially fewer standardized rather than many ad hoc schemata are required to facilitate the
      documentation and exchange of knowledge within electron microscopy. We tailored NXem to serve the materials science and
      materials engineering usage of electron microscopy to provide a complementary coverage to what OMERO has established for
      the bio- and life science usage of electron microscopy.

          Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
          by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose

          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
          when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
          codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
          for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
          duration is not relevant - use this start_time field.

          Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both a start_time
          and an end_time because this enables software tools and users to collect a
          more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.

          Users should be aware though that even using only start_time and end_time
          may not be sufficient to infer how long the experiment took or for how long
          data were acquired. To bookkeep more fine-grained timestamps over the
          course of the experiment is possible with start_time and end_time fields
          of respective :ref:`NXem_event_data` instances.

            Ideally, this would enable a binary recreation from the input data.

            Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
            instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
            also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific set
            of base classes, application definitions, and contributed definitions
            with which the here described concepts can be resolved.

            For the `pynxtools library <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_
            which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_
            research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
            repository commit and respective submodule references used.

            Instances can also be used to document the modules and libraries that
            are offered by the computational environment such as those parsed

          A physical entity which contains material intended to be investigated.
          Sample and specimen are treated as de facto synonyms.
          Samples can be real or virtual ones as annotated via is_simulation.

          The suggested best practice is to call this group sample. In those cases when
          multiple samples need to be grouped inside one entry, these SAMPLE groups
          should be named using the prefix sample followed an index starting from 1, i.e.
          (sample1, sample2).

          There are at least two strategies how to store (meta)data when one analyzes multiple
          samples - not different ROIs on a single sample though - in one session.

          One strategy is to store each sample and its results under an own NXem/ENTRY.
          This is one of the most frequent use cases as during most sessions typically only a
          single sample is investigated. In this case the name of this group should be sample.

          If multiple samples are investigated storing each of them in their own ENTRY group eventually will
          demand unnecessary duplication of instrument details.

          This can be avoided by using another strategy for storing samples and their results.
          Namely, by using only one instance of NXem/ENTRY. That NXem/ENTRY should then be named,
          like in the previous case, NXem/entry1 and the samples should be named sample1, sample2, etc.,
          i.e. instances should use sample as a name prefix.

          In this case the collection of events should use identifier_sample to state clearly for which
          of the samples loaded the (characterization) event was detected.

          This concept is related to term `Specimen`_ of the EMglossary standard.

            Ideally, (globally) unique persistent identifier which distinguishes this sample from all others
            and especially the predecessor/origin from where that sample was cut off. An example of cutting off
            is a steel sheet that is the parent sample from which a small portion was wire-eroded that
            represents the sample that was then prepared for characterization with an electron microscope.

            The terms sample and specimen are here considered as exact synonyms.

            This field must not be used for an alias for the sample name. Instead, use name.

            In cases where multiple specimens were loaded into the microscope, the identifier has to resolve
            the specific sample, whose results are stored by this :ref:`NXentry` instance, because a single
            NXentry should be used for the characterization of a single specimen.

            Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in resources referring to identifier_parent.

            ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
            when the specimen was prepared.

            Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known timestamp when
            the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Ideally, this matches
            the last timestamp that is mentioned in the digital resource pointed to by
            identifier_parent.

            Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially
            required for material that is sensitive to the environment such as specimens that were
            charged with fast diffusing elements or short-lived radioactive tracers.

            Additional time stamps prior to preparation_date are better placed in resources which
            describe but do not pollute the description here with prose. Resolving these
            connected metadata is considered the responsibility of the research data management
            system and not the a NeXus file.

            to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret these from the resources

            The information is recorded to qualify if the beam used was likely
            able to shine through the specimen. For scanning electron microscopy,
            in many cases the specimen is typically thicker than what is illuminable
            by the electron beam.

            In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of the specimen
            viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal surface normal of the
            specimen is parallel to the optical axis.
