=============================
NXDL Elements and Field Types
=============================

The documentation in this section has been obtained directly
from the NXDL Schema file:  *nxdl.xsd*.
First, the basic elements are defined in alphabetical order.
Attributes to an element are indicated immediately following the element
and are preceded with an "@" symbol, such as
**@attribute**.
Then, the common data types used within the NXDL specification are defined.
Pay particular attention to the rules for *validItemName*
and  *validNXClassName*.

    2010-11-29,PRJ:
    This contains a lot of special case code to lay out the NXDL chapter.
    It could be cleaner but that would also involve some cooperation on
    anyone who edits nxdl.xsd which is sure to break.  The special case ensures
    the parts come out in the chosen order.  BUT, it is possible that new
    items in nxdl.xsd will not automatically go in the manual.
    Can this be streamlined with some common methods?
    Also, there is probably too much documentation in nxdl.xsd.  Obscures the function.

NXDL Elements
=============

    

.. index:: ! attribute (NXDL element)

.. _attribute:

attribute
---------




An ``attribute`` element can *only* be a child of a
``field`` or ``group`` element.
It is used to define *attribute* elements to be used and their data types
and possibly an enumeration of allowed values.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.attributeType`

        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! choice (NXDL element)

.. _choice:

choice
------




A ``choice`` element is used when a named group might take one
of several possible NeXus base classes.  Logically, it must
have at least two group children.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.choiceType`
                



.. index:: ! definition (NXDL element)

.. _definition:

definition
----------




A ``definition`` element can *only* be used
at the root level of an NXDL specification.
Note:  Due to the large number of attributes of the ``definition`` element,
they have been omitted from the figure below.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.definition`,
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.definitionType`, and
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.definitionTypeAttr`

        "Design" tab.  Identify the structure to be documented and double-click to expand
        as needed to show the detail.  Use the XSD > "Export Diagram as Image ..." menu item (also available
        as button in top toolbar).
        Set the name: "nxdl_definition.png" and move the file into the correct location using
        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! dimensions (NXDL element)

.. _dimensions:

dimensions
----------




The ``dimensions`` element describes the *shape* of an array.
It is used *only* as a child of a ``field`` element.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.dimensionsType`
                



.. compound::

    .. _fig.nxdl_dimensions:

        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! doc (NXDL element)

.. _doc:

doc
---




A ``doc`` element can be a child of most NXDL elements.  In most cases, the
content of the ``doc`` element will also become part of the NeXus manual.

:element: {any}:

In documentation, it may be useful to
use an element that is not directly specified by the NXDL language.
The *any* element here says that one can use any element
at all in a ``doc`` element and NXDL will not process it but pass it through.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.docType`
                



.. compound::

    .. _fig.nxdl_doc:

        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! enumeration (NXDL element)

.. _enumeration:

enumeration
-----------




An ``enumeration`` element can *only* be a child of a
``field`` or ``attribute`` element.
It is used to restrict the available choices to a predefined list,
such as to control varieties in spelling of a controversial word (such as
*metre* vs. *meter*).

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.enumerationType`

        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! field (NXDL element)

.. _field:

field
-----




The ``field`` element provides the value of a named item.  Many different attributes
are available to further define the ``field``.  Some of the attributes are not
allowed to be used together (such as ``axes`` and ``axis``); see the documentation
of each for details.
It is used *only* as a child of a ``group`` element.

        your operating system's commands.  Commit the revision to version control.



.. index:: ! group (NXDL element)

.. _group:

group
-----




A ``group`` element can *only* be a child of a
``definition`` or ``group`` element.
It describes a common level of organization in a NeXus data file, similar
to a subdirectory in a file directory tree.

For more details, see:
:ref:`NXDL.data.type.groupType`

.. _link:

link
----




.. index::
    single: link target

A ``link`` element can *only* be a child of a
``definition``,
``field``, or ``group`` element.
It describes the path to the original source of the parent
``definition``,
``field``, or ``group``.

.. _NXDL.data.types.internal:

NXDL Field Types (internal)
===========================

Field types that define the NXDL language are described here.
These data types are defined in the XSD Schema (``nxdl.xsd``)
and are used in various parts of the Schema to define common structures
or to simplify a complicated entry.  While the data types are not intended for
use in NXDL specifications, they define structures that may be used in NXDL specifications.



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='attributeType']

.. index:: ! attributeType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.attributeType:

attributeType
-------------



Any new group or field may expect or require some common attributes.

..
	Could contain these elements:

	* ``doc``
	* ``enumeration``

(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


Attributes of attributeType
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@name
+++++

    

    Name of the attribute (unique within the enclosing group).
    

@optional
+++++++++

    

    Is this attribute *optional* (if **true**)
    or *required* (if **false**)?
    

@recommended
++++++++++++

    

    A synonym for optional, but with the recommendation that this
    attribute be specified.
    

@type
+++++

    

    Type of the attribute.
    For ``group`` specifications, the class name.
    For ``field`` or ``attribute`` specifications,
    the NXDL field type.
    

Elements of attributeType
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

dimensions
++++++++++

    

    dimensions of an attribute with data value(s) in a NeXus file
    

doc
+++

    

    Description of this ``attribute``.
    This documentation will go into the manual.
    

enumeration
+++++++++++

    

    An enumeration specifies the values to be used.
    


.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:element[@name='definition']

.. index:: ! definition (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.definition:

definition
----------



A ``definition`` element
is the ``group`` at the
root of every NXDL specification.
It may *only* appear
at the root of an NXDL file and must only appear 
**once** for the NXDL to be *well-formed*.



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='definitionType']

.. index:: ! definitionType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.definitionType:

definitionType
--------------



A ``definition`` is the root element of every NXDL definition.
It may *only* appear at the root of an NXDL file and must only 
appear **once** for the NXDL to be *well-formed*.

The ``definitionType`` defines the documentation, 
attributes, fields, and groups that will be used
as children of the ``definition`` element.
Could contain these elements:

* ``attribute``
* ``doc``
* ``field``
* ``group``
* ``link``

Note that a ``definition`` element also includes the definitions of the 
``basicComponent`` data type.
(The ``definitionType`` data type is used internally in the NXDL schema 
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)

Note that the first line of text in a ``doc`` element in a ``definition``
is used as a summary in the manual.  Follow the pattern as shown
in the base class NXDL files.


Attributes of definitionType
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@category
+++++++++

    

    NXDL ``base`` definitions define the dictionary
    of terms to use for these components.
    All terms in a ``base`` definition are optional.
    NXDL ``application`` definitions define what is
    required for a scientific interest.
    All terms in an ``application`` definition
    are required.
    NXDL ``contributed`` definitions may be
    considered either base or applications.
    Contributed definitions must indicate
    their intended use, either as a base class or
    as an application definition.
    

@extends
++++++++

    

    The ``extends`` attribute allows this definition
    to *subclass* from another NXDL,
    otherwise ``extends="NXobject"`` should be used.
    

@ignoreExtraAttributes
++++++++++++++++++++++

    

    Only validate known attributes; do not not warn about unknowns.
    The ``ignoreExtraAttributes`` attribute is a flag to the process of
    validating NeXus data files.  By setting ``ignoreExtraAttributes="true"``,
    presence of any undefined attributes in this class will not generate warnings
    during validation.  Normally, validation will check all the attributes
    against their definition in the NeXus base classes and
    application definitions.  Any items found that do not match the definition
    in the NXDL will generate a warning message.
    
    The ``ignoreExtraAttributes`` attribute should be used sparingly!
    

@ignoreExtraFields
++++++++++++++++++

    

    Only validate known fields; do not not warn about unknowns.
    The ``ignoreExtraFields`` attribute is a flag to the process of
    validating NeXus data files.  By setting ``ignoreExtraFields="true"``,
    presence of any undefined fields in this class will not generate warnings
    during validation.  Normally, validation will check all the fields against
    their definition in the NeXus base classes and
    application definitions.  Any items found that do not match the definition
    in the NXDL will generate a warning message.
    
    The ``ignoreExtraFields`` attribute should be used sparingly!
    

@ignoreExtraGroups
++++++++++++++++++

    

    Only validate known groups; do not not warn about unknowns.
    The ``ignoreExtraGroups`` attribute is a flag to the process of
    validating NeXus data files.  By setting ``ignoreExtraGroups="true"``,
    presence of any undefined groups in this class will not generate warnings
    during validation.  Normally, validation will check all the groups against
    their definition in the NeXus base classes and
    application definitions.  Any items found that do not match the definition
    in the NXDL will generate a warning message.
    
    The ``ignoreExtraGroups`` attribute should be used sparingly!
    

@name
+++++

    

    The ``name`` of this NXDL file (case sensitive without the file extension).
    The name must be unique amongst all the NeXus base class, application,
    and contributed definitions.  For the class to be adopted by the NIAC,
    the first two letters must be "``NX``" (in uppercase).  Any other use
    must *not* begin with "``NX``" in any combination
    of upper or lower case.
    

@restricts
++++++++++

    

    The ``restricts`` attribute is a flag to the data validation.
    When ``restricts="1"``, any non-standard component found
    (and checked for validity against this NXDL specification)
    in a NeXus data file will be flagged as an error.  If the
    ``restricts`` attribute is not present, any such situations
    will produce a warning.
    

@svnid
++++++

    

    (2014-08-19: deprecated since switch to GitHub version control)
    The identifier string from the subversion revision control system.
    This reports the time stamp and the revision number of this file.
    

@type
+++++

    

    Must be ``type="group"``
    

Elements of definitionType
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

symbols
+++++++

    

    Use a ``symbols`` list  
    to define each of the mnemonics that
    represent the length of each dimension in a vector or array.
    

Groups under definitionType
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    

    In addition to an optional ``symbols`` list,
    a ``definition`` may contain any of the items
    allowed in a ``group``.
    


.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:simpleType[@name='definitionTypeAttr']

.. index:: ! definitionTypeAttr (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.definitionTypeAttr:

definitionTypeAttr
------------------



Prescribes the allowed values for ``definition`` ``type`` attribute.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define a data type.)




    The value may be any
    one from this list only:

    * ``group``
    * ``definition``
    



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='dimensionsType']

.. index:: ! dimensionsType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.dimensionsType:

dimensionsType
--------------



dimensions of a data element in a NeXus file
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


Attributes of dimensionsType
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@rank
+++++

    

    Rank (number of dimensions) of the data structure.
    
    Value could be either an unsigned integer or a symbol
    as defined in the *symbol* table of the NXDL file.
    
    For example: ``a[5]`` has ``rank="1"`` while
    ``b[8,5,6,4]`` has ``rank="4"``.
    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_%28computer_programming%29 for more details.
    

Elements of dimensionsType
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

dim
+++

    

    Specify the parameters for each index of the ``dimensions``
    element with a ``dim`` element.
    The number of ``dim`` entries should be equal to
    the ``rank`` of the array.
    For example, these terms
    describe a 2-D array with lengths (``nsurf``, ``nwl``):
    
    .. code-block:: xml
    	:linenos:
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The ``value`` attribute is used by NXDL and also by
    the NeXus data file validation tools to associate and coordinate the
    same array length across multiple fields in a group.

        Deprecated: 2016-11-23 telco 
        (https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/330)
        
        The dimension specification is related to
        the ``refindex`` axis within the ``ref`` field by an
        offset of ``incr``.  Requires ``ref`` and ``refindex``
        attributes to be present.
        

@index
~~~~~~

        

        Number or symbol indicating which axis (subscript) is
        being described, ranging from 1 up to
        ``rank`` (rank of the
        data structure).  For example, given an array
        ``A[i,j,k]``,
        ``index="1"`` would refer to the
        ``i`` axis (subscript).

        The dimension specification is the same as
        that in the ``ref`` field, specified either by a relative path,
        such as ``polar_angle`` or ``../Qvec`` or absolute path, such as
        ``/entry/path/to/follow/to/ref/field``.

        The dimension specification is the same as
        the ``refindex`` axis within the ``ref`` field.
        Requires ``ref`` attribute to be present.
        

@required
~~~~~~~~~

        

        This dimension is required (true: default) or not required (false).
        
        The default value is ``true``.
        
        When ``required="false"`` is
        specified, all subsequent ``<dim`` nodes
        (with higher ``index`` value)
        **must** also have ``required="false"``.
        

@value
~~~~~~

        

        Integer length (number of values), or mnemonic symbol
        representing the length of this axis.
        

doc

    Documentation might be necessary to describe how the parts
    of the ``dimensions`` element are to be used.

.. index:: ! docType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.docType:

docType
-------



NXDL allows for documentation on most elements using the ``doc``
element. The documentation is useful in several contexts. The documentation will be
rendered in the manual. Documentation, is provided as tooltips
by some XML editors when editing NXDL files.
Simple documentation can be typed directly in the NXDL::


		Descriptive name of sample


This is suitable for basic descriptions that do not need extra formatting
such as a bullet-list or a table. For more advanced control, use the rules
of restructured text, such as in the :ref:`NXdetector` specification.
Refer to examples in the NeXus base class NXDL files such as :ref:`NXdata`.

Could contain these elements:

* *any*

enumerationType
---------------



An ``enumeration`` restricts the values allowed for a specification.
Each value is specified using an ``item`` element, such as:
``<item value="Synchrotron X-ray Source" />``.
Could contain these elements:

* ``doc``
* ``item``

Enumerations can be closed or open. A closed enumeration is one where the list of
values are the only ones allowed for a specification. An open enumeration is one 
where the list of values is incomplete and additional values other than those listed
are allowed. Open enumerations should be used sparingly as the designer of the enumeration
should try to find all possible values for a given field/attribute.

In case an open enumeration is used and the data provider wants to declare that the provided
value deliberately not from the given list of values, the data provider should,

* for fields, set the attribute ``@custom=True``.
* for attributes, set an additional attribute ``@my_attribute_custom=True``, where
  ``my_attribute`` is the name of the attribute with the open enumeration.

Such attributes can be used deliberately to suppress warnings in NeXus validators.


Attributes of enumerationType
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@open
+++++

    

    Is this an open enumeration?
    An open enumeration allows additional values not listed.
    

Elements of enumerationType
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

item
++++

    

    One of the prescribed values.  Use the ``value`` attribute.
    
    Defines the value of one selection for an ``enumeration`` list.
    Each enumerated item must have a value (it cannot have an empty text node).
    

@value
~~~~~~

        

        The value of ``value`` of an ``enumItem``
        is defined as an attribute rather than a name.
        

doc
~~~

        

        Individual items can be documented
        but this documentation might not be printed in the
        *NeXus Reference Guide*.
        


.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='fieldType']

.. index:: ! fieldType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.fieldType:

fieldType
---------



A ``field`` declares a new element in the component being defined.
A ``field`` is synonymous with the HDF4 SDS (Scientific Data Set) and
the HDF5 *dataset* terms.   Could contain these elements:

* ``attribute``
* ``dimensions``
* ``doc``
* ``enumeration``

Note that a ``field`` element also includes the definitions of the
``basicComponent`` data type.
(The ``fieldType`` data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


@axes
+++++

    

    NOTE: Use of the ``axes`` attribute for a
    *field* is discouraged.  It is for legacy
    support. You should use the ``axes`` group
    attribute (such as in NXdata) instead.
    
    This attribute contains a string array that
    defines the independent data fields used in
    the default plot for all of the dimensions
    of the *signal* field (the *signal* field is
    the field in this group that is named by the
    ``signal`` attribute of this group).
    
    When there is only one item in the string array,
    it is acceptable to set the value to the one string.
    In such case, it is not necessary to make it
    an array of one string.
    
    Presence of the ``axes`` attribute means
    this field is an ordinate.
    

@axis
+++++

    

    NOTE: Use of this attribute is discouraged.  It is for legacy support.
    You should use the ``axes`` group
    attribute (such as in NXdata) instead.
    
    Presence of the ``axis`` attribute means this field is an abscissa.
    
    The attribute value is an integer indicating this
    field as an axis that is part of the data set.
    The data set is a field with the attribute
    ``signal=1`` in the same group.
    The value can range from 1 up to the number of
    independent axes (abscissae) in the data set.
    
    A value of ``axis=1``" indicates that this field
    contains the data for the first independent axis.
    For example, the X axis in an XY data set.
    
    A value of ``axis=2`` indicates that this field
    contains the data for the second independent axis.
    For example, the Y axis in a 2-D data set.
    
    A value of ``axis=3`` indicates that this field
    contains the data for the third independent axis.
    For example, the Z axis in a 3-D data set.
    
    A field with an ``axis`` attribute should
    not have a ``signal`` attribute.
    

@data_offset
++++++++++++

    

    The ``stride`` and ``data_offset`` attributes
    are used together to index the array of data items in a
    multi-dimensional array.  They may be used as an alternative
    method to address a data array that is not stored in the standard NeXus
    method of "C" order.
    
    The ``data_offset`` attribute
    determines the starting coordinates of the data array
    for each dimension.
    
    See https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/phypereg.html
    or *4. Dataspace Selection Operations* in
    https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Dataspaces
    
    The ``data_offset`` attribute contains a
    comma-separated list of integers.
    (In addition to the required comma delimiter,
    whitespace is also allowed to improve readability.)
    The number of items in the list
    is equal to the rank of the data being stored.  The value of each
    item is the offset in the array of the first data item of that
    subscript of the array.
    

@interpretation
+++++++++++++++

    

    This instructs the consumer of the data what the last dimensions
    of the data are. It allows plotting software to work
    out the natural way of displaying the data.
    
    For example a single-element, energy-resolving, fluorescence detector
    with 512 bins should have ``interpretation="spectrum"``. If the
    detector is scanned over a 512 x 512 spatial grid, the data reported
    will be of dimensions: 512 x 512 x 512.
    In this example, the initial plotting representation should default to
    data of the same dimensions of a 512 x 512 pixel ``image``
    detector where the images where taken at 512 different pressure values.
    
    In simple terms, the allowed values mean:
    
    * ``scalar`` = 0-D data to be plotted
    * ``scaler`` = DEPRECATED, use ``scalar``
    * ``spectrum`` = 1-D data to be plotted
    * ``image`` = 2-D data to be plotted
    * ``rgb-image`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    * ``rgba-image`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    * ``hsl-image`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    * ``hsla-image`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    * ``cmyk-image`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    * ``vertex`` = 3-D data to be plotted
    

@long_name
++++++++++

    

    Descriptive name for this field (may include whitespace and engineering units).
    Often, the long_name (when defined) will be used as the axis label on a plot.
    

@maxOccurs
++++++++++

    

    Defines the maximum number of times this element may be used.  Its
    value is confined to zero or greater.  Must be greater than or equal to
    the value for the "minOccurs" attribute.
    A value of "unbounded" is allowed.
    

@minOccurs
++++++++++

    

    Defines the minimum number of times this ``field`` may be used.  Its
    value is confined to zero or greater.  Must be less than or equal to
    the value for the "maxOccurs" attribute.
    

@optional
+++++++++

    

    A value of "true" is equivalent to minOccurs=0 while a value of
    "false" is equivalent to minOccurs>0.
    

@primary
++++++++

    

    Integer indicating the priority of selection
    of this field for plotting (or visualization) as an axis.
    
    Presence of the ``primary`` attribute means this
    field is an abscissa.
    

@recommended
++++++++++++

    

    A synonym for optional, but with the recommendation that this
    ``field`` be specified.
    

@signal
+++++++

    

    Presence of the ``signal`` attribute means this field is an ordinate.
    
    Integer marking this field as plottable data (ordinates).
    The value indicates the priority of selection or interest.
    Some facilities only use ``signal=1``
    while others use ``signal=2`` to indicate
    plottable data of secondary interest.
    Higher numbers are possible but not common
    and interpretation is not standard.
    
    A field with a ``signal`` attribute should not have an ``axis`` attribute.
    

@stride
+++++++

    

    The ``stride`` and ``data_offset`` attributes
    are used together to index the array of data items in a 
    multi-dimensional array.  They may be used as an alternative
    method to address a data array that is not stored in the standard NeXus
    method of "C" order.
    
    The ``stride`` list chooses array locations from the
    data array  with each value in the ``stride`` list
    determining how many elements to move in each dimension.
    Setting a value in the ``stride`` array to 1 moves
    to each element in that dimension of the data array, while
    setting a value of 2 in a location in the ``stride``
    array moves to every other element in that dimension of the
    data array.  A value in the ``stride`` list may be
    positive to move forward or negative to step backward.
    A value of zero will not step (and is of no particular use).
    
    See https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/phypereg.html
    or *4. Dataspace Selection Operations* in
    https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Dataspaces
    
    The ``stride`` attribute contains a
    comma-separated list of integers.
    (In addition to the required comma delimiter,
    whitespace is also allowed to improve readability.)
    The number of items in the list
    is equal to the rank of the data being stored.  The value of each
    item is the spacing of the data items in that subscript of the array.
    

@type
+++++

    

    Defines the type of the element as allowed by NeXus.
    
    See :ref:`here<Design-DataTypes>` and :ref:`elsewhere<nxdl-types>` for the complete list of allowed types.
    

@units
++++++

    

    String describing the engineering units.
    The string should be appropriate for the value.
    
    * If a unit is not provided by the list of NeXus 
      unit categories, instead of providing a category, 
      a field element can include an example of the 
      units directly.
    
    * The example does not constrain the scale of the 
      units. For example, if the unit is ``eV/mm``, the
      user could specify in a data file ``eV/cm``, or any 
      other unit that is convertible to the example given.
    
    It is recommended that users and application developers 
    check if their units and their unit examples adhere to 
    the UDUNITS standard.  [#]_
    
    Conformance is not validated at this time.

.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='choiceType']

.. index:: ! choiceType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.choiceType:

choiceType
----------



A ``choice`` element is used when a named group might take one
of several possible NeXus base classes.  Logically, it must
have at least two group children.


Attributes of choiceType
++++++++++++++++++++++++

@name
+++++

    

    The name to be applied to the selected child group.  
    None of the child groups should define a 
    ``@name`` attribute.
    

Elements of choiceType
++++++++++++++++++++++

group
+++++

    

    NeXus base class that could be used here.
    The group will take the ``@name`` attribute 
    defined by the parent ``choice`` element
    so do not specify the ``@name`` attribute of
    the group here.
    


.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='groupType']

.. index:: ! groupType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.groupType:

groupType
---------



A group element refers to the definition of 
an existing NX object or a locally-defined component.
Could contain these elements:

* ``attribute``
* ``doc``
* ``field``
* ``group``
* ``link``

Note that a ``group`` element also includes the definitions of the 
``basicComponent`` data type.
(The ``groupType`` data type is used internally in the NXDL schema 
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


Attributes of groupType
+++++++++++++++++++++++

@maxOccurs
++++++++++

    

    Maximum number of times this ``group`` is allowed to be present within its
    parent ``group``.  Note each ``group`` must have a ``name`` attribute
    that is unique among all ``group`` and ``field``
    declarations within a common parent ``group``.
    

@minOccurs
++++++++++

    

    Minimum number of times this ``group`` is allowed to be present within its
    parent group.  Note each ``group`` must have a ``name`` attribute
    that is unique among all ``group`` and ``field``
    declarations within a common parent group.
    

@name
+++++

    

    A particular scientific application may expect
    a name of a ``group`` element. It is helpful but not
    required to specify the ``name``
    attribute in the NXDL file.
    It is suggested to always specify a ``name``
    to avoid ambiguity.  It is also suggested to 
    derive the ``name`` from the 
    type, using an additional number suffix as necessary.
    For example, consider a data file with only one 
    ``NXentry``.  The suggested default 
    ``name`` would
    be ``entry``.  For a data file with two or more
    ``NXentry`` groups, the suggested names would be
    ``entry1``, ``entry2``, ...
    Alternatively, a scientific application such as small-angle 
    scattering might require
    a different naming procedure; two different ``NXaperture`` groups
    might be given the names ``beam_defining_slit``
    and ``scatter_slit``.
    

@optional
+++++++++

    

    A value of "true" is equivalent to minOccurs=0 while a value of
    "false" is equivalent to minOccurs>0.
    

@recommended
++++++++++++

    

    A synonym for optional, but with the recommendation that this
    ``group`` be specified.
    

@type
+++++

    

    The ``type`` attribute *must* 
    contain the name of a 
    NeXus base class, application definition, or contributed definition.
    


.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='linkType']

.. index:: ! linkType (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.linkType:

linkType
--------



A link to another item.  Use a link to avoid
needless repetition of information.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


@napimount
++++++++++

    

    Group attribute that provides a URL to a group in another file.
    More information is described in the *NeXus Programmers Reference*.
    
    https://github.com/nexusformat/code/blob/master/doc/api/NeXusIntern.pdf
    

@target
+++++++

    

    Declares the absolute HDF5 address of an existing field or group.
    
    The target attribute is added for NeXus to distinguish the
    HDF5 path to the original dataset.
    
    Could contain these elements:
    
    * ``doc``
    
    Matching regular expression::
    
    	(/[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*(:[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*)?)+
    
    For example, given a
    ``/entry/instrument/detector/polar_angle`` field,
    link it into the ``NXdata`` group
    (at ``/entry/data/polar_angle``).
    This would be the NeXus data file structure::
    
    	/: NeXus/HDF5 data file
    		/entry:NXentry
    			/data:NXdata
    				/polar_angle:NX_NUMBER
    					@target="/entry/instrument/detector/polar_angle"

.. _NXDL.data.type.basicComponent:

basicComponent
--------------



A ``basicComponent`` defines the allowed name

and ``group`` specifications.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define elements and attributes to be used by users in NXDL specifications.)


Attributes of basicComponent
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@name
+++++

    

    The ``name`` attribute is the
    identifier string for this entity.
    It is required that ``name`` must be unique
    within the enclosing ``group``.
    The name must match the regular expression
    defined by ``validItemName``.
    (Historical note:
    Originally, the rule (``validItemName``) was defined to allow
    only names that can be represented as valid variable names
    in most computer languages.
    )

.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:simpleType[@name='validItemName']

.. index:: ! validItemName (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.validItemName:

validItemName
-------------



Used for allowed names of elements and attributes.  
Note: No ``-`` characters (among others) are allowed
and you cannot start or end with a period (``.``).
HDF4 had a 64 character limit on names 
(possibly including NULL) and the NAPI enforces this 
via the ``NX_MAXNAMELEN`` variable with 
a **64** character limit (which
may be 63 on a practical basis if one considers a NULL
terminating byte).
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema 
to define a data type.)
NOTE: In some languages, it may be necessary to add a
``^`` at the start and a ``$`` at the end of the regular
expression to constrain the match to an entire line.




    The value may be any
    ``xs:token`` that *also* matches the regular expression::

        [a-zA-Z0-9_]([a-zA-Z0-9_.]*[a-zA-Z0-9_])?



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:simpleType[@name='validNXClassName']

.. index:: ! validNXClassName (NXDL data type)

validNXClassName
----------------



Used for allowed names of NX class types (e.g. NXdetector).
Note this is *not* the instance name (e.g. ``bank1``)
which is covered by ``validItemName``.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema 
to define a data type.)




    The value may be any
    ``nx:validItemName`` that *also* matches the regular expression::

        NX.+



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:simpleType[@name='validTargetName']

.. index:: ! validTargetName (NXDL data type)


.. _NXDL.data.type.validTargetName:

validTargetName
---------------



This is a valid link target - currently it must be an absolute path
made up of valid names with the ``/`` character delimiter.  But we may
want to consider allowing "``..``" (parent of directory) at some point.
If the ``name`` attribute is helpful, then use it in the path 
with the syntax of *name:type* as in these examples::

	/NXentry/NXinstrument/analyzer:NXcrystal/ef
	/NXentry/NXinstrument/monochromator:NXcrystal/ei
	/NX_other

Must also consider use of ``name`` attribute in resolving ``link`` targets.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema 
to define a data type.)


    

    From the HDF5 documentation:
    
    	*Note that relative path names in HDF5 do not employ the ``../`` notation, 
    	the UNIX notation indicating a parent directory, to indicate a parent group.*
    
    Thus, if we only consider the case of 
    ``[name:]type``, the matching regular expression syntax
    is written: ``/[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*(:[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*)?)+``.
    Note that HDF5 also permits relative path names, such as:
    ``GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1``
    but this is not permitted in the matching regular expression and not supported in NAPI.
    



    The value may be any
    ``xs:token`` that *also* matches the regular expression::

        (/[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*(:[a-zA-Z_][\w_]*)?)+



.. Xpath = /xs:schema/xs:simpleType[@name='nonNegativeUnbounded']

A ``nonNegativeUnbounded`` allows values including
all positive integers, zero, and the string ``unbounded``.
(This data type is used internally in the NXDL schema
to define a data type.)



**The** ``xs:string`` **data type**
    The ``xs:string`` data type can contain characters,
