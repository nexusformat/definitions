################################################################

NeXus is a common data format for neutron, 
x-ray, and muon science. It is developed as an 
international standard by scientists and programmers 
representing major scientific facilities in Europe, Asia, 
Australia, and North America in order to facilitate 
greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization 
of neutron, x-ray, and muon data.
