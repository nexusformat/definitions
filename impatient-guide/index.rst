Why NeXus?

   formats.

The NeXus data format [#NeXus]_ is a tool which has been designed to
solve the problems of travelling scientists, 
who undertake experiments at several different
neutron, x-ray or muon facilities. Such people will apply to
different facilities with different proposals in order to get
their science done, then combine the data thus collected at the various
sources. However, the life of a travelling scientist is complicated by
some of the following factors:

* They will find several different file formats at each facility, some
  of which may even be proprietary formats which only can be read
  by expensive tools.
* They waste time writing programs to get the data into their favourite
  data analysis software.
* They may need many different files in different formats,
  plus local knowledge and notes in order to analyse data.
* They have to deal with inefficient data formats.
* They cannot easily read their collaborators' data.

NeXus is designed to solve these problems by defining a data
format with the following properties:

self-describing
   The content of the file can be discovered
   without prior knowledge.
extendable
   This means that you can always add more data to the file.
platform independent
   It must be readable on UNIX, Macintosh, Windows or whatever computers.
public domain
   Both the file format specifications and the API to access the file data
   must be in the public domain.
efficient
   Data from modern high speed detectors should be both written and read quickly.
complete
   All data required for typical usage cases should be contained in one file; even
   better, a full beam line description.
flexible
   In order to be applicable to a wild variety of applications.


NeXus Concepts
==============

NeXus uses `HDF-5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ 
[#HDF5]_
files as container files. HDF-5 is a popular scientific
data format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  and currently
maintained by *The HDF Group*. There is built-in support for HDF-5 in many scientific
packages. Other users of HDF-5 include NASA, Boeing, meteorological offices around
the world and many more. NeXus is thus able to inherit many desirable properties
for free from HDF-5, such as: extendable, self-describing, platform independent,
public domain, and efficient. For historical reasons, NeXus supports two further
container file formats: HDF-4 and XML. The NeXus use of these formats is now deprecated.

To understand NeXus, it is important to know about some of the objects
encountered in an HDF-5 file:

groups
   Allow structuring of information in a file. Groups work pretty much like
   folders/directories in a file system.
datasets
   These are multidimensional arrays of numbers and character strings.
attributes
   These are little morsels of metadata which can be attached to either
   groups or datasets.
links
   These are pointers to HDF-5 objects which live in a different place in the
   hierarchy. They remove the need to copy data when a given item needs to be
   referenced at multiple places in an HDF-5 hierarchy. HDF-5 Links behave
   like symbolic links in a UNIX file system.

HDF-5 does not, however, know anything about the application domain of neutron, muon or
X-ray scattering. In order to remedy this, NeXus adds the following:

A group hierarchy in the HDF-5 file
  A group hierarchy in the files helps with a couple of issues. If a full beamline
  description is stored, then this can easily be hundreds of parameters - a hierarchy
  brings some order into a potential mess. The hierarchy also allows us to store more
  then one experiment and/or result of data analysis in the same file. Thus a
  NeXus file may contain a complete scientific workflow from raw data to publishable
  results.
Rules for storing data in a file
  NeXus wants you to store physical values, with units and uncertainty, but the
  motor encoder positions,  control voltages, set points, *etc.* can be stored
  as well.  Each dataset should indicate the axes required to plot the
  data.  By prescribing the structure of the data fields, we minimize the
  amount of variations and surprises when accessing NeXus files.
A dictionary of field names
  Even with units and axes available, an item with a name like *stx* has
  little meaning. NeXus provides a dictionary of names applicable to neutron,
  x-ray or muon scattering and documents their meanings.
Application Definitions
  In order to import data seamlessly into an application program the file producer
  and the file consumer have to agree what has to be in the NeXus file for a certain
  use case. This is the purpose of an application definition. Application definitions
  are used to define strict standards. NeXus files can be verified against application
  definitions with a special tool called nxvalidate.
Tools
  In order to make dealing with HDF-5 files easier, NeXus has provided an API for reading
  and writing files for many programming languages. Moreover, NeXus has coded some
  tools for converting to and from NeXus as well as plotting and viewing utilities.


The NeXus File Hierarchy
------------------------

NeXus defines two main group hierarchy types:

#. :ref:`raw_file_hierarchy`
#. :ref:`processed_data_hierarchy`

There are additional hierarchy variations for multi-method instruments and for a
general purpose dump structure. Documentation for these hierarchy types can be
found in the NeXus manual.


.. _raw_file_hierarchy:

The NeXus Raw Data File Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This hierarchy is applicable to raw data files as written by some facility instrument:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   entry:NXentry
      @default = data
      data:NXdata
         @signal = data
         data --> /entry/instrument/detector/data
      instrument:NXinstrument
         source:NXsource
         ....
         detector:NXdetector
            data:NX_INT32[512,512]
      sample:NXsample
      control:NXmonitor



The following two groups are required for all NeXus data files:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   entry:NXentry
      data:NXdata

.. sidebar::  About the terms: ``entry:NXentry``

   A NeXus group is shown with a two-part name, as in ``entry:NXentry``.
   The first part, shown here as ``entry`` is the HDF5 group name 
   and can be just about
   any text that is a valid variable name in most programming languages.
   See the NeXus manual [#Manual]_ for full details and note that **no spaces
   are allowed**.  The second part, shown here as ``NXentry``, is the 
   name of the NeXus class that describes the structure within this group.


``entry:NXentry``
    At the top/root level of a NeXus file are the NXentry groups.
    Each entry represents a separate collection of datasets.

``data:NXdata``
    This group is supposed to hold the most
    important data items of the experiment.
    This is a convenience so that a general plotting
    program can identify *from this group alone* what is
    the default data to render on a plot. 
    Therefore the data is linked here from the specific 
    detector entry recording the data which is described below. 
    Axis information is usually included here as well, the 
    details of which are covered in the NeXus manual.

The following additional groups are present in many NeXus data files:

``sample:NXsample``
    This group contains datasets which describe everything we
    know about the sample, including sample environment information
    such as temperature.

``instrument:NXinstrument``
    This group contains further groups and fields which describe
    the components of the instrument (i.e. beamline for synchroton sources)
    used for this experiment.

``control:NXmonitor``
    This group contains the counting information: which preset
    was used, how long we counted, monitor counts, etc.

.. note::  A few words on notation in this representation:

   indentation
       Describes hierarchy level
   ``name:NXname``
       This describes a NeXus group. The second name, starting with ``NX``, is the NeXus
       class name of the group. Each NeXus class defines a set of allowed field names
       that may be used to describe a component of the experiment,
       such as detector distance and angle. Not all such names are required -
       those relevant to a particular use case are specified by the appropriate application definition.
       Some experiments have multiple groups
       of the same class, such as apertures and detectors.
   ``name:NX_TYPE[dim,dim,...]``
       This describes a dataset with a given numeric type and dimensions.  In this
       example, the detector data is a 512 x 512 array of 32-bit integers.
   ``@name=value``
       This describes an attribute name and value.  
       Both groups and fields can have attributes.
       The attribute ``signal=data`` indicates
       to NeXus that the field in this group named ``data`` is the dependent data to be plotted.
   ``name -->  path``
       Describes a link from one location to another.  This allows us to gather
       the most important data together in an ``NXdata`` group while leaving
       detailed metadata in the individual component definitions.
       NeXus uses HDF5 hard links for pointing to other objects in the same file
       and external links when pointing to objects in other HDF5 files.


What goes into a NeXus File?
----------------------------

Before starting to describe how to decide what goes into a NeXus file,
some more details about NeXus groups and base classes need to be
explained. As seen in the examples, NeXus uses groups with well-defined 
class names starting with "NX". NeXus calls these NX classes
"base classes", which is slightly misleading when you are used to
object-oriented notations. For each NeXus base class, there
exists a dictionary description that details which other groups and
which fields are allowed in this base class. This dictionary is where you will find
appropriate field names for the data items you wish to describe. The NeXus base
classes are documented in the NeXus Reference Manual. [#RefDoc]_
A common
misconception among NeXus beginners is that you have to specify all
fields which exist in a given NeXus base class. This is **not**
the case! You only need to choose those fields from the NeXus base
class dictionary which make sense for your application. But, you are
encouraged to store additional, available information 
since it can be used to diagnose problems with the instrument. The minimum
set of fields that are appropriate to a given technique are usually
specifed in an "application definition".

Before the mechanics of writing a NeXus file can be explained, we need
to know which fields are written into the NeXus file at which position
in the hierarchy. The example will be to store basic data. 
Some steps are required:

Example 3: NeXus Raw Data File Template

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   entry:NXentry
      instrument:NXinstrument
      sample:NXsample
      control:NXmonitor
      data:NXdata

#. The start is a NeXus raw data file template as shown in example 3.
#. At this level you can decide what needs to be known about the
   sample and put it into the NXsample group.
#. Look at a design drawing of the instrument. For each major
   instrument component find a suitable NeXus class and add it
   to the NXinstrument group.
#. Decide for each instrument component which data fields are
   required  and add them to the corresponding group.
#. Add required counting information to the control class.
#. Decide which data sets make up the most important data items
   in the experiment. Create links to these data items in the data
   group.
#. Investigate if a NeXus application definition exists for
   your instrument type. If so, check if all required fields
   are stored in the appropriate form.

Before beginning this process, it might be worthwhile to look at some
of the NeXus application definitions in the NeXus reference manual
for examples and inspiration. But be aware that each NeXus application
definition only defines the minimum sets for a certain usage case.

In this process you might encounter the situation that you wish to
store more information then foreseen by NeXus. There are two options
which have to be considered:

#. The data item to store is special to your instrument and of no general
   interest. Then make up a name and store it. The beauty of NeXus is
   that this is possible without breaking the standard compliance
   of the file.  Usual practice is to use a pattern like ``facilityname_fieldname``
   which is unlikely to collide with fields that are added to the NeXus
   definition in the future.
#. The data item is of general interest and should be added to NeXus.
   Then suggest a name and document what this really is what you suggest.
   Forward this information to the NeXus International Advisory Committee
   (nexus-committee@nexusformat.org).
   Usually such suggestions are accepted quickly when they pose no
   conflicts with existing definitions.

Be sure that the names of things you define have no embedded whitespace 
and begin with a letter.

.. _processed_data_hierarchy:

The NeXus Processed Data Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simplified hierarchy style applicable to the results of data
reduction or data analysis applications. Such results can consist of
large multidimensional arrays, so it can be advisable to use NeXus
for storing such data:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   entry:NXentry
      @entry = data
      reduction:NXprocess
         program_name = "pyDataProc2010"
         version = "1.0a"
         input:NXparameters
            filename = "sn2013287.nxs"
      sample:NXsample
      data:NXdata
         @signal = data
         data


Here the ``NXentry`` contains:

``@entry = data``
    Attribute on the ``NXentry`` group pointing to the default ``NXdata``
    group to be plotted.
``data:NXdata``
    Contains the result of the data reduction directly, together with
    the axes required to use the data.  The attribute ``@signal = data``
    indicates that the field named ``data`` is the default plottable data.
``sample:NXsample``
    Contains the sample information.  This may be a link to the
    sample information within a measurement entry elsewhere in the file.
``reduction:NXprocess``
    This group is used to document what kind of processing occurred to
    obtain the results stored in this ``NXentry``. Here NeXus documents the name
    and version of the program used to do the reduction.
``input:NXparameters``
    The ``NXparameters`` groups describe the input and output
    parameters of the data reduction program. NeXus does not provide
    standard names here but rather provides containers to store this
    information which is important to make results reproducible.

Optionally, a processed data entry can contain an ``NXinstrument`` group
in order to describe the instrument if this matters at this stage.


Scans in NeXus
--------------

Scanning means to vary some variable in a certain, defined way and collect
data as the variable progresses. Scans are a versatile experimental technique and are
thus very difficult to standardize. NeXus solves this problem through
a couple of rules. Before these rules can be discussed, the symbol **NP**
has to be introduced. NP is simply the number of scan points.

#. During a scan store each varied variable as an array of length NP at its
   appropriate place in the NeXus hierarchy.
#. For area detectors, the first (slowest varying) dimension becomes NP. 
   Example: data from an area detector is stored as 
   ``data[NP,xdim,ydim]``
#. In ``NXdata``, create links to all varied parameters and the detector
   data. Thus a representation similar to the conventional table
   representation of a scan is achieved.

This is an example of a NeXus raw data file describing a scan where the
sample is rotated and data is collected in an area detector:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   entry:NXentry
      @entry = data
      instrument:NXinstrument
         detector:NXdetector
            data:[NP,xsize,ysize]
      sample:NXsample
         rotation_angle[NP]
      control:NXmonitor
         data[NP]
      data:NXdata
         @signal = 1
         @axes = rotation_angle . .
         @rotation_angle_indices = 0
         data --> /entry/instrument/detector/data
         rotation_angle --> /entry/sample/rotation_angle

The default data to be plotted has more dimensions and requires
additional description.  The attribute ``@axes = rotation_angle . .``
implies that the "signal data" (``data``) has three dimensions.
The first dimension is provided by the ``rotation_angle`` field, 
while the ``.`` for the other two dimensions indicates they each
should be plotted as index number (starting from zero).
The attribute ``@rotation_angle_indices = 0`` declares that ``rotation_angle``
is used as the first dimension of ``data``.  The ``AXISNAME_indices`` 
attribute becomes more useful when both the "signal data" and the dimension
scales are multi-dimensional.

Finding the plottable data
--------------------------

Any program whose aim is to identify plottable data should use the following procedure:

#. Start at the top level of the NeXus data file
   (the *root* of the HDF5 hierarchy).

#. Pick the default ``NXentry`` group, as designated by the ``default`` attribute.

#. Pick the default ``NXdata`` group, as designated by the ``default`` attribute.

#. Pick the default plottable field, as designated by the ``signal`` attribute.
   
   #. Pick the fields with the dimension scales (the ``axes`` attribute).
   
   #. Associate dimension scales with plottable data dimensions (the ``AXISNAME_indices`` attributes).
      
   #. Associate the dimension scales with each dimension of the plottable data.

#. Plot the *signal* data, given *axes* and *AXISNAME_indices*.

For details of this process, consult this 
`section <https://manual.nexusformat.org/datarules.html#version-3>`_ 
of the NeXus manual. [#v3]_

NeXus Benefits
==============

When trying to establish a data standard, we encounter a few challenges,
some of which can slow effort:

Science does new things
    By definition, science is about doing new things, and of course new things
    cannot always be forced into strict standards. Thus any standardization effort
    in science will be an ongoing process.
Consensus
    In order to establish a standard, a large portion of a scientific community must agree.
Resources
    A data standard requires scientific programming resources to
    implement in acquisition and analysis software, but such resources
    are scarce especially at already established facilities.

However, there are many benefits to be gained from having the NeXus
data standard:

Discoverable format
   By using a standard container format, people can examine their data
   from many software packages without any coding at all.
NeXus dictionary
   Using field names from a well documented dictionary gives meaning
   to the data in the file.
Programming
   Using suitable programming techniques a data processing program
   can read any NeXus file which contains the required data easily.
Storing complete data
   Storing all this metadata when saving the data takes extra effort,
   but benefits include:

     * The file will include the necessary fields for yet unforeseen ways to
       analyse the data.
     * If something is wrong with the data, it becomes possible to figure
       out what went wrong.
     * There is a better record of what has been measured. 
       This helps to protect against scientific fraud.
Application definitions
   For common measurement techniques with well-defined data reduction and
   analysis steps, data files with all the required fields included can
   be processed automatically.  The NeXus application definitions serve
   the role of defining which fields are needed for a given measurement type.


Reading NeXus Files
===================

The simplest way to read and plot a NeXus file is through the Python *PyTree* API:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import nxs
   nxs.load('powder.h5').plot()

In order for this to be possible, *PyTree* uses the NeXus conventions to locate
the plottable data and the axes to use.  In particular, this plots the first
``NXdata`` group in the first ``NXentry`` in the ``powder.h5`` file.  The NeXus python
package provides additional support for working with NeXus groups.

The plot could also be created by directly accessing the HDF-5 file using the
h5py [#h5py]_ package:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import pylab, h5py
   file = h5py.File('powder.h5')
   pylab.plot(file['/entry1/data1/two_theta'], file['/entry1/data1/counts'])
   pylab.title(file['/entry1/title'][0])
   pylab.show()

Matlab support in version R2011b is similar:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

   >> two_theta = h5read('powder.h5', '/entry1/data1/two_theta');
   >> counts = h5read('powder.h5', '/entry1/data1/counts');
   >> title = h5read('powder.h5', 'entry1/title');
   >> plot(two_theta, counts)
   >> title(title)

Note that matlab will require explicit casting from integer data to floating
point data to perform many operations.  For example, to plot a 2D data set 
[#lrcs3701]_ using log intensity:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

    >> data = h5read('lrcs3701.nx5','/Histogram1/data/data');
    >> h = pcolor(log(double(data+1))); set(h,'EdgeAlpha',0)
	
Support for HDF is available in other scientific computing environments,
including IDL, Igor, Mathematica and R.

Reading the file using the HDF-5 C API is a little more involved:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   /**
    * Reading example for reading NeXus files with plain
    * HDF-5 API calls. This reads out counts and two_theta
    * out of the file generated by nxh5write.
    *
    * WARNING: I left out all error checking in this example.
    * In production code you have to take care of those errors
    *
    * Mark Koennecke, October 2011
    */
   #include <hdf5.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   int main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
     float *two_theta = NULL;
     int *counts = NULL,  rank, i;
     hid_t fid, dataid, fapl;
     hsize_t *dim = NULL;
     hid_t datatype, dataspace, memdataspace;

     /*
      * Open file, thereby enforcing proper file close
      * semantics
      */
     fapl = H5Pcreate(H5P_FILE_ACCESS);
     H5Pset_fclose_degree(fapl,H5F_CLOSE_STRONG);
     fid = H5Fopen("NXfile.h5", H5F_ACC_RDONLY,fapl);
     H5Pclose(fapl);

     /*

      */
     dataid = H5Dopen(fid,"/scan/data/counts");

     counts = malloc(dim[0]*sizeof(int));

     H5Dread(dataid,memdataspace,H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL,H5P_DEFAULT, counts);
     H5Dclose(dataid);
     H5Sclose(dataspace);
     H5Tclose(memdataspace);

     two_theta = malloc(dim[0]*sizeof(float));
     memdataspace = H5Tcopy(H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
     H5Dread(dataid,memdataspace,H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL,H5P_DEFAULT, two_theta);
     H5Dclose(dataid);
     H5Sclose(dataspace);
     H5Tclose(memdataspace);

     H5Fclose(fid);

     for(i = 0; i < dim[0]; i++){
       printf("%8.2f %10d\n", two_theta[i], counts[i]);
     }

   }

.. note:: To keep these examples short, we already learned the HDF addresses 
   of the "signal data" (such as ``/entry1/data1/counts``)
   and its associated dimension scales (such as ``/entry1/data1/two_theta``)
   for each example data file.  
   The examples above use those addresses directly, rather than using the 
   described method to find the plottable data.  
   
   If you are writing specific
   code to process a set of NeXus files where you already know the HDF5 addresses
   of the items you need, feel welcome to use that knowledge, as you have seen above.
   
   If you are writing code to handle any NeXus data file, then you are advised
   to implement the methods to find the plottable data,
   as described in the manual.  [#v3]_

More examples of reading NeXus data files can be found in 
the *Examples* chapter of the NeXus Reference Documentation. [#RefDoc]_

Writing NeXus Files
===================

You can obviously skip this section if you only wish to read NeXus files. 

For writing the NeXus file, you have the option to use the NeXus API or to
use the HDF-5 API. The complexity of NeXus file writing code is
similar to the reading code. For both approaches, more information is
available in the NeXus Manual [#Manual]_ 
or the NeXus Reference Documentation. [#RefDoc]_

To give you a taste of what it is like to write a NeXus file using the
NeXus API, here is a complete code example in C. It shows how to create a
``scan:NXentry/data:NXdata`` structure and store two arrays, counts and
two_theta:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   #include "napi.h"

   int writer(float *tth, float *counts, int n)
   {
      /* we receive two arrays: tth and counts, each length n*/
      NXhandle fileID;
      NXopen ("NXfile.nxs", NXACC_CREATE, &fileID);
         NXmakegroup (fileID, "Scan", "NXentry");
         NXopengroup (fileID, "Scan", "NXentry");
            NXmakegroup (fileID, "data", "NXdata");
            NXopengroup (fileID, "data", "NXdata");
               NXputattr (fileID, "signal", "counts", 6, NX_CHAR);
               NXputattr (fileID, "axes", "two_theta", 9, NX_CHAR);
               NXmakedata (fileID, "two_theta", NX_FLOAT32, 1, &n);
               NXopendata (fileID, "two_theta");
                  NXputdata (fileID, tth);

Who is behind NeXus?
--------------------

NeXus was developed from three independent proposals from Jonathan Tischler,
APS, Przemek Klosowski, NIST and Mark Koennecke, ISIS (now PSI) by an
international team of scientists during a series of SoftNess workshops
in 1994 - 1996. More work was done during NOBUGS conferences. Since 2001,
NeXus is overseen by the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC)
which meets once a  year. The NIAC strives to have a representative for
each participating facility. The NIAC has a constitution which you can
find on the NeXus WWW site.
