         Base class to describe discretized (micro)structural features of a material.
         
         One instance of this base class can be used to describe the current configuration
         the base class does not include time-dependent descriptions for the sake of
         clarity and because of the fact that virtually all simulations or experiments
         probe time by sampling. Therefore, time-dependent state descriptions should
         be realized with creating a set of :ref:`NXms_snapshot_set` with instances of
         :ref:`NXms_snapshot` using e.g. :ref:`NXms_recon` base class instances.
