         Base class for describing the interaction volume of particle-matter interaction.
         
         Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
         interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
         the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
         or single-particle resolved sets of trajectories.
         
         Explicit or implicit descriptions are possible.
         
         * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
           represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
         * An explicit description is via an iso-contour surface using either
           a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
           iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
           Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle fluxes through
           an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface).
           Threshold values can be defined by particles passing through a unit control
           volume (electrons) or energy-levels (e.g. the case of X-rays).
           Details depend on the model.
         * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
           be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
         
         Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
         is available in the literature for example:
