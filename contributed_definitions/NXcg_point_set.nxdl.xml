         Computational geometry description of a set of points in Euclidean space.
         
         The relevant coordinate system should be referred to in the NXtransformations
         instance. Points may have an associated time value; however users are advised
         to store time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where
         for each point in time there is an NXcg_point_set instance which specifies the
         points locations. This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer
         simulations, where positions of points are taken at the same point in time;
         and therefore an additional time array would demand to store redundant pieces
         of information for each point.

             Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
             identifiers for points. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
             interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
