		A group of positioners in an experimental which work in concert to 
		change the orientation of the sample or another device.

		The specification lists only two NXpositioners, however any number can 
		be included as additional NXpositioner groups. The value of all the 
		positioners should be taken into account when setting the orientation, 
		which should describe the concerted effect of the motors.
