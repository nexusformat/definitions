    <doc>
        A base class for bias spectroscopy to describe the change in the physical properties
        of the sample with respect to the sweep voltage applied on a sample of STM/AFM/... experiments.
        
        In these experiments an electric potential is applied between the (conductive) sample and the probe
        (tip), and the physical properties (e.g. tunnelling current) are measured as the function of this
        potential. The potential is varied in so-called voltage sweeps and the corresponding properties are
        recorded accordingly.

    <field name="measurement_type">
        <doc>
            The measurement type defines how current is measured under the different input variables like
            bias voltage (constant_spacing) or height (variadic_spacing) is applied during the measurement.

            by this identifier. For example, scan on a sample of TiSe2 with layered of evaporated pyrene and
            annealed at 300K temperature for 5 min process.
