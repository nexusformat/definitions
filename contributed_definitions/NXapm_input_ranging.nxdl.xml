         Metadata to ranging definitions made for a dataset in atom probe microscopy.
         
         Ranging is the process of labeling time-of-flight data with so-called iontypes
         which ideally specify the most likely ion/molecular ion evaporated within a
         given mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval.
         
         The paraprobe-toolbox uses the convention that the so-called UNKNOWNTYPE
         iontype (or unranged ions) represents the default iontype.
         The ID of this special iontype is always reserved as 0. Each ion
         is assigned to the UNKNOWNTYPE by default. Iontypes are assigned
         by checking if the mass-to-charge-state-ratio values of an ion matches
         to any of the defined mass-to-charge-state-ratio intervals.

    <field name="filename">
        <doc>
             Path and name of the NeXus/HDF5 file which stores ranging definitions.
        </doc>
        <attribute name="version">
            <doc>
                 Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256 strong)
                 hash. Such hashes serve reproducibility as they can be used for tracking
                 provenance metadata in a workflow.
            </doc>
        </attribute>
    </field>
    <field name="group_name_iontypes">
        <doc>
             Name of the group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions) inside
             the file referred to by filename which points to the specific ranging
             definition to use.
             An HDF5 file can store multiple ranging definitions. Using an ID is
             the mechanism to distinguish which specific ranging (version) will
             be processed. Reconstruction and ranging IDs can differ.
             They specify different IDs.
