             Name of (NeXus)/HDF5 file which stores ranging definitions which define
             how mass-to-charge-state ratios map to iontypes and which iontypes are
             distinguished. The UNKNOWNTYPE iontype (unranged) is the default iontype.
             The ID of this special iontype is always reserved as 0. Each ion
             is assigned to the UNKNOWNTYPE by default. Iontypes are assigned
             by checking if the mass-to-charge-state ratio of an ion matches
             to any of the defined mass-to-charge-state ratio intervals.

        <attribute name="version" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                 Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256) hash
                 which documents the binary state of the file to add an additional layer
                 of reproducibility for tracking provenance.

    <field name="group_name_iontypes" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Name of the group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions)
             inside the HDF5 file which refers to the ranging definition to use.
             A HDF5 file can store multiple ranging definitions. Using an ID is
             the mechanism to distinguish which specific ranging (version) will
             be processed. Reconstruction and ranging IDs can differ.
             They specify different IDs.
