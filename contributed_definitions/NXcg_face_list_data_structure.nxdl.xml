    <doc>
         Computational geometry description of geometric primitives via a face and edge list.
         
         Primitives must not be degenerated or self-intersect.
         Such descriptions of primitives are frequently used for triangles and polyhedra
         to store them on disk for visualization purposes. Although storage efficient,
         such a description is not well suited for topological and neighborhood queries
         of especially meshes that are built from primitives.
         
         In this case, scientists may need a different view on the primitives which
         is better represented for instance with a half_edge_data_structure instance.
         The reason to split thus the geometric description of primitives, sets, and
         specifically meshes of primitives is to keep the structure simple enough for
         users without these computational geometry demands but also enable those more
         computational geometry savy users the storing of the additionally relevant
         data structure.
         
         This is beneficial and superior over NXoff_geometry because for instance a
         half_edge_data_structure instance can be immediately use to reinstantiate
         the set without having to recompute the half_edge_structure from the vertex
         and face-list based representation and thus offer a more efficient route
         to serve applications where topological and graph-based operations are key.

             It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively in which

             mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
             the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.
