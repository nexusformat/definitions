for instance you might be super interested in analyzing in find details the iso-surfaces of carbon in a dataset
but in addition you could be interested also to study chromium iso-surfaces but for completely different iso-contour values

you create one process for all your carbon related delocalizations, isosurfaces etc

                         Delocalization in the field of atom probe microscopy is the process
                         of discretizing a point cloud. By default the tool computes a full
                         kernel density estimation of decomposed ions to create one discretized
                         field for each element.
                         
                         Although, this uses an efficient multithreaded algorithm,
                         the computation is costly. Therefore, it can be advantageous for users
                         to load an already computed delocalization. This can be achieved with

                         Matrix of isotope vectors representing iontypes.
                         The filter specifies a matrix of isotope_vectors which is the most
                         general approach to define if and how many times an ion is counted.
                         Currently, paraprobe_nanochem performs a so-called atomic decomposition
                         of all iontypes. Specifically, the tool interprets of how many
                         elements/atoms a molecular ion is composed; and thus determines the
                         atoms multiplicity with respect to the iontype.
                         
                         Let's take the hydroxonium H3O+ molecular ion as an example:
                         It contains hydrogen and oxygen as atoms. The multiplicity of hydrogen
                         is three whereas that of oxygen is one. Therefore in an atomic
                         decomposition computation of the iso-surface each H3O+ ion adds
                         three hydrogen counts. This is a practical solution which accepts
                         the situation that during an atom probe experiment not each bond
                         of each ion/a group of neighboring atoms is broken but molecular
                         ions get detected. The exact ab-initio details depend on the local
                         field conditions and thus also the detailed spatial arrangement
                         of the atoms and their own electronic state and that of the neighbors
                         before and upon launch.
                         Being able to measure the information for such sites only as
                         molecular ions causes an inherent information loss with respect to the
                         detailed spatial arrangement. This information loss is more relevant
                         for local electrode atom probe than for field ion microscopy setting
                         how precisely the atomic positions can be reconstructed.
                         Accounting for multiplicities assures that at least the
                         compositional information is analyzed.

                             As it is detailed in M. Kühbach et al. 2022 npj Comp. Mat.,
                             the handling of triangles at the edge of the dataset requires
                             special attention. Especially for composition-normalized
                             delocalization it is possible that the composition increases
                             towards the edge of the dataset because the quotient of two numbers
                             which are both smaller than one is larger instead of smaller than
                             the counter. By default, the tool uses a modified marching cubes
                             algorithm of Lewiner et al. which detects if voxels face such a
                             situation. In this case, no triangles are generated for such voxels.
                             Alternatively, (via setting keep_edge_triangles) the user can
                             instruct the tool to not remove these triangles at the cost of bias.
                             
                             Specifically, in this case the user should understand that all
                             objects/microstructural features in contact with the edge of the
                             dataset get usually artificial enlarged and their surface mesh
                             often closed during the marching. This closure however is artificial!
                             It can result in biased shape analyses for those objects.
                             The reason why this should in general be avoided is a similar
                             argument as when one analyzes grain shapes in orientation microscopy
                             via e.g. SEM/EBSD. Namely, these grains, here the objects at the
                             edge of the dataset, were not fully captured during e.g. limited
                             field of view.
                             Therefore, it is questionable if one would like to make
                             substantiated quantitative statements about them.
                             
                             Thanks to collaboration with the V. V. Rielli and S. Primig, though,
                             paraprobe-nanochem implements a complete pipeline to
                             process even these objects at the edge of the dataset. Specifically,
                             the objects are replaced by so-called proxies, i.e. replacement
                             objects whose holes on the surface mesh have been closed if possible
                             via iterative mesh and hole-filling procedures with fairing operations.
                             In the results of each paraprobe-nanochem run, these proxy objects
                             are listed separately to allow users to quantify and analyze in
                             detail the differences when accounting for these objects or not.
                             Especially this is relevant in atom probe microscopy as objects
                             can contain a few dozen atoms only.
                             Users should be aware that results from fairing operations should
                             be compared to results from analyses where all objects at the edge
                             of the dataset have been removed.
                             
                             Also users should be careful with overestimating the statistical
                             significance of their dataset especially when using atom probe
                             to compare multiple descriptors: Even though a dataset may give
                             statistically significant results for compositions, this does not
                             necessarily mean it will yield also statistically significant
                             and unbiased results for three-dimensional object analyses.
                             Being able to quantify these effects and making atom probers
                             aware of these subtleties was one of the main reasons why the
                             paraprobe-nanochem tool was implemented.

                             close to the edge of the dataset. If an object has at least one ion
                             with an ion-to-edge-distance below this threshold, the object is
                             considered as one which lies close to the edge of the dataset.
                             This implements essentially a distance-based approach to solve
                             the in general complicated and involved treatment of computing

                             can face numerical robustness issues as a consequence of which a
                             mesh can be detected as lying completely inside a dataset although
                             in reality it is epsilon-close only, i.e. almost touching only
                             the edge (e.g. from inside).
                             Practically, humans would state in such case that the object is
                             close to the edge of the dataset; however mathematically the object
                             is indeed completely inside.
                             In short, a distance-based approach is rigorous and more flexible.

                             for each identified closed polyhedron. It is common that a
                             marching cubes algorithm creates iso-surfaces with a fraction of very
                             small sub-complexes (e.g. small isolated tetrahedra).
                             
                             These can be for instance be small tetrahedra/polyhedra about the

                             When these objects are small, it is possible that they contain no ion;
                             especially when considering that delocalization procedures smoothen
                             the positions of the ions. Although these small objects are interesting
                             from a numerical point of view, scientists may argue they are not worth
                             to be reported:
                             Physically a microstructural feature should contain at least a few

                             In fact, the volume bounded by the polyhedron has sharp edges.
                             When taking two objects, an edge of one object may for instance
                             pierce into the surface of another object. In this case the
                             objects partially overlap / intersect volumetrically; 
                             however this piercing might be so small or happening in the volume
                             between two ion positions and thus sharing ions is a sufficient
                             but not a necessary condition for object intersections.

                             point-like) connected channels, where tetrahedralization libraries
                             have challenges dealing with. In this case checking intersections
                             via shared_ions is a more practical alternative.

                             Such proxies are closed via iterative hole-filling, mesh refinement,

                             ROIs. A possible intersection of these with the edge of the
                             dataset, i.e. the triangulated surface mesh model for the edge
                             is performed. This test checks if the cylinder intersects with
                             a triangle of the surface mesh. If this is the case, the ROI is
                             assumed to make edge contact, else, the ROI is assumed to have
                             no edge contact.
                             
                             This approach does not work if the ROI would be completely
                             outside the dataset. Also in this case there would be
                             no intersection. For atom probe this case is practically
                             irrelevant because for such a ROI there would also be no ion
                             laying inside the ROI. Clearly it has thus to be assumed that
                             the edge model culls the entire dataset. Instead, if one would
                             cut a portion of the dataset, compute an edge model for this
                             point cloud, it might make sense to place a ROI but in this
                             case the edge contact detection is not expected to work properly.

                             Interfacial excess computations are performed for local regions-of-interests
                             (ROIs) at selected facets or interface patch.
                             For instance many scientist compute the interfacial excess for
                             selected triangle facets of a created iso-surface. In this case,
                             computed iso-surfaces of paraprobe could be used. An example are triangle
                             facet sets about closed polyhedra, for instance to compute interfacial
                             excess related to phase boundaries of second-phase precipitates.
                             
                             Another example are free-standing triangle patches of the iso-
                             surfaces which paraprobe creates. These could be characterized
                             for interfacial excess. The sub-routines during iso-surface
                             computations already include a procedure to automatically align
                             local triangle normals based on the gradients of e.g. composition
                             fields. In this case, these triangulated surface patches
                             could also be used as a source for computing interfacial
                             excess.
                             
                             Often scientists face situations, though, in which there is no
                             immediately evident composition gradient across the interface
                             (grain or phase boundary) and orientation information about the
                             adjoining crystal is neither available nor reliable enough.
                             
                             In this case `P. Felfer et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.06.002&gt;`_ proposed a method
                             to manually place control points and run an automated tessellation-based
                             algorithm to create a triangulated surface patch, i.e. a model of the
                             location of the interface. In a post-processing step this triangle
                             set can then be used to compute again interfacial excess in an
                             automated manner by placing ROIs and aligning them with
                             consistently precomputed triangle normals.
                             
                             A similar use case is conceptually the one proposed by `X. Zhou et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2022.117633&gt;`_
                             They used first a deep-learning method to locate planar triangulated
                             grain boundary patches. These are eventually processed further
                             with manual editing of the mesh via tools like Blender.
                             Once the user is satisfied with the mesh, the computations of interfacial
                             excess reduce again to an automated placing of ROIs, computations
                             of the distributing of ions to respective ROIs and
                             reporting the findings via plotting.
                             
                             Yet another approach for constructing an triangulated surface patch
                             of an interface is to use point cloud processing methods which have
                             been proposed in the laser-scanning, geoinformatics, and CAD community.
                             Different computational geometry methods are available for fitting
                             a parameterized surface to a set of points, using e.g. non-uniform
                             rational B-splines (NURBS) and triangulating these according
                             to prescribed mesh quality demands.
                             
                             The advantage of these methods is that they can be automated and
                             pick up curved interface segments. The disadvantage is their often
                             strong sensitivity to parameterization. As a result also such methods
                             can be post-processed to yield a triangulated surface patch,
                             and thus enable to run again automated ROI placement methods.
                             For example like these which were explored for the use case of
                             iso-surfaces with closed objects and free-standing
                             surface patches that delineate regions of the dataset with a
                             pronounced composition gradient normal to the interface.
                             
                             This summary of the situations which atom probers can face when
                             requesting for interfacial excess computations, substantiates there

                             The interface model is the result of a previous (set of) processing
                             steps as a result of which the user has created a triangulated

                             These interface models are useful, if not required, in cases when

                                 Users should be aware that triangulated surface meshes are
                                 only approximations to a given complex, eventually curved shape.
                                 Consequently, computations of normals show differences between
                                 the vertex and facet normals. Vertex normals have to be
                                 interpolated from normals of neighboring facets. Consequently,
                                 these normals are affected by the underlying parameterization
                                 and curvature estimation algorithms, irrespective of how
                                 contributions from neighboring facets are weighted. By contrast,
                                 facet normals are clearly defined by the associated triangle.
                                 Their disadvantage is that they the normal field has discontinuities
                                 at the edges. In general the coarser an object is triangulated
                                 the more significant the difference becomes between computations
                                 based on facet or vertex normals.
                                 Paraprobe-nanochem works with facet normals as it can use 
                                 parts of the numerical performance gained by using cutting
                                 edge libraries to work rather with finer meshes.

                     free-standing interface patch through a point cloud of decorating solutes.
                     These models can be useful for quantification of Gibbsian
                     interfacial excess for interfaces where iso-surface based methods
                     may fail or closed objects from iso-surfaces are not desired or
                     when e.g. there are no substantial or consistently oriented
                     concentration gradients across the interface patch.
                     
                     The interface_meshing functionality of paraprobe-nanochem can be useful
                     when there is also insufficient latent crystallographic information
                     available that could otherwise support modelling the interface,
                     via e.g. ion density traces in field-desorption maps, as were used and
                     discussed by `Y. Wei et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225041&gt;`_

                     It is noteworthy that the method here used is conceptually very similar

                     Noteworthy, her team uses the DCOM approach originally proposed by P. Felfer et al.
                     However, both of these previous works neither discuss in detail
                     nor implement inspection functionalities which enable a detection of
                     potential geometric inconsistencies or self-interactions of the
                     resulting DCOM mesh. This is what paraprobe-nanochem implements

                     Functionalities for placing regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the dataset
                     or at specific microstructural features to characterize composition
                     profiles and cumulated profiles for quantification of interfacial excess.
                     Paraprobe-nanochem currently places cylindrical ROIs. ROIs are probed
                     across the triangulated surface of a user-defined mesh.
                     ROIs are placed at the barycenter of the triangular facet.
                     
                     The tool can be instructed to orient the profile for each ROIs with
                     the positive normal of the triangle facet normals. Profiles are
                     computed for each ROI and facet triangle. The code will test which
                     ROIs are completely embedded in the dataset.
                     Specifically, in this test the tool evaluates if the ROI cuts at least
                     one triangle of the triangulated surface mesh of the edge of the dataset.
                     If this is the case the ROI will be considered close to the edge
                     (of the dataset) and not analyzed further; else the ROI will be
                     processed further.
                     Users should be aware that the latter intersection analysis is strictly
                     speaking not a volumetric intersection analysis as such one is much
                     more involved because the edge model can be a closed non-convex polyhedron
                     in which case one would have to test robustly if the cylinder pierces
                     or is laying completely inside the polyhedron. For this the polyhedron has
                     to be tessellated into convex polyhedra as otherwise tests like the
                     Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm would not be applicable.
                     
                     Specifically, the tool computes atomically decomposed profiles.
                     This means molecular ions are split into atoms/isotopes with respective
                     multiplicity. As an example an H3O+ molecular ion contains three
                     hydrogen and one oxygen atom respectively. The tool then evaluates
                     how many ions are located inside the ROI or on the surface of the
                     ROI respectively. All atom types and the unranged ions are distinguished.
                     As a result, the analyses yield for each ROI a set of sorted lists of
                     signed distance values. Currently, the distance is the projected
                     distance of the ion position to the barycenter of the triangle
                     and triangle plane.
                     
                     This will return a one-dimensional profile. Post-processing the set
                     of atom-type-specific profiles into cumulated profiles enable the
                     classical Krakauer/Seidman-style interfacial excess analyses.
                     Furthermore, the tool can be instructed to compute for each
                     (or a selected sub-set of facet) a set of differently oriented profiles.

 of aligning the ROI because alignments of ROI based on triangle
