            <doc>
                 Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlation is the process of building logical
                 relations between volumetric features based on meshes, their proximity and
                 eventual intersections. Volumetric overlap and proximity of volumetric
                 features is identified for members of sets of features to members of
                 other sets of volumetric features.
                 Specifically, for each time step k pairs of sets are compared:
                 Members of a so-called current_set to members of a so-called next_set.
                 Members can be different types of volumetric features.
                 In the analysis of M. Kuehbach et al. specifically features can be
                 so-called objects (closed non-degnerated polyhedra representing watertight
                 parts of an e.g. iso-surface) and/or proxies. Proxies are computed
                 doppelganger/replacement meshes for parts of an iso-surface which initially
                 were not resulting in watertight meshes because objects at the edge
                 of the dataset or incompletely measured or truncated objects.
            </doc>
            <field name="intersection_detection_method">
                <doc>
                     Specifies the method whereby to decide if two objects intersect volumetrically.
                     For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of
                     `M. Kühbach et al. &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510&gt;`_, the tool by
                     default assumes that two objects intersect if they share at least one
                     ion with the same evaporation ID (shared_ion).
                     Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections,
                     the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to 
                     tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks
                     for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra to identify if two objects
                     intersect or not.
                     
                     However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
                     cases which the currently used library (TetGen) was not unable to
                     tetrahedralize successfully. These cases were virtually always
                     associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra which had portions
                     of the mesh that were connected by almost point like tubes of triangles.
                     Finding more robust methods for computing intersections between
                     not necessarily convex polyhedra might improve the situation in the future.
