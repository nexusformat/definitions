         Container for components of a focused-ion-beam (FIB) system.
         
         FIB capabilities turn especially scanning electron microscopes
         into specimen preparation labs. FIB is a material preparation
         technique whereby portions of the sample are illuminated with a
         focused ion beam with controlled intensity intense enough and with
         sufficient ion momentum to remove material in a controllable manner.
         
         The fact that an electron microscope with FIB capabilities has needs a
         second gun with own relevant control circuits, focusing lenses, and
         other components, warrants an own base class to group these components
         and distinguish them from the lenses and components for creating and
         shaping the electron beam.

(NXtransformation):
   doc: |
     A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used whose positive
     z-axis points in the direction of the ion beam, i.e. towards the
     sample. For modelling ion milling it is relevant to document the
     illumination vector. NXtransformations offers a place to store how the
     ion gun coordinate system has to be rotated to align its positive z-axis
     with the positive z-axis of e.g. the electron beam and ion beam
     respectively.-->
