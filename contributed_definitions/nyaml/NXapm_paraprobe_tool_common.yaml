NXapm_paraprobe_tool_common(NXobject):
  status(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A statement whether the tool executable managed to process the analysis
      or whether this failed. Status is written to the results file after the
      end_time beyond which point in time the tool must no longer compute
      any further analysis results but exit.
      
      Only when this status message is present and its value is `success`,
      one should consider the results of the tool. In all other cases it might
      be that the tool has terminated prematurely or another error occurred.
    enumeration: [success, failure]
  identifier_analysis(NX_UINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Internal identifier used by the tool to refer to an analysis.
      Simulation ID is an alias.
  config(NXnote):
    doc: |
      The configuration file that was used to parameterize
      the algorithms that this tool has executed.
  programID(NXprogram):
    nameType: partial
  profiling(NXcs_profiling):
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis in this results file was started,
        i.e. when the respective executable/tool was started as a process.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis in this results file were
        completed and the respective process of the tool exited.
    total_elapsed_time(NX_FLOAT):
      unit: NX_TIME
      doc: |
        Wall-clock time.

      Details about coordinate systems (reference frames) used. In atom probe several coordinate
      systems have to be distinguished. Names of instances of such :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
      should be documented explicitly and doing so by picking from the
      following controlled set of names:
      
      * paraprobe_reference_frame
      * lab_reference_frame
      * specimen_reference_frame
      * laser_reference_frame
      * instrument_reference_frame
      * detector_reference_frame
      * reconstruction_reference_frame
      
      The aim of this convention is to support users with contextualizing which reference frame
      each instance (coordinate system) is. If needed, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations`
      are used to detail the explicit affine transformations whereby one can convert
      representations between different reference frames.
      Inspect :ref:`NXtransformations` for further details.
