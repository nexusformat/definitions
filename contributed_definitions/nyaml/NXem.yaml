  Application definition for normalized representation of electron microscopy research.
  
  This application definition is a comprehensive example for a general description
  with which to normalize specific (meta)data collected from the research field
  of electron microscopy
  
  NXem is designed to be used for documenting experiments or computer simulations in which
  controlled electron beams are used for studying electron-beam matter interaction to explore
  physical mechanisms and phenomena or to characterize materials with an electron microscope.

  # docstrings should be organize as such a list of blocks:
  # -| req: first part, concept definition, human-readable but such that one could take as is to define an concept in OWL
  # -| opt: second part, comment, i.e. information that in an ideal world would be ideal if represented strongly semantic
  # but for practical purposes currently is interpretable only by human to provide them further contextualization
  # -| recommended: xref part ideally also as a list of triple (spec, term, url to uri)

        doc: |
          A collection of all programs and libraries that are considered as relevant
          to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
          generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
          
          Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
          instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
          also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific set
          of base classes, application definitions, and contributed definitions
          with which the here described concepts can be resolved.
          
          For the `pynxtools library <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_
          which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_
          research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
          repository commit and respective submodule references used.
          
          Instances can also be used to document the modules and libraries that
          are offered by the computational environment such as those parsed
          from conda or python virtualenv environments.

      doc: |
        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
        by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
        into the field. The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
        The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn in how far the
        current base classes need extension based on user feedback.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
        when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
        codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
        for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
        duration is not relevant - use this start_time field.
        
        Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both a start_time
        and an end_time because this enables software tools and users to collect a
        more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
        
        Users should be aware though that even using only start_time and end_time
        may not be sufficient to infer how long the experiment took or for how long
        data were acquired. To bookkeep more fine-grained timestamps over the
        course of the experiment is possible with start_time and end_time fields
        of respective :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):

        An example how to use this set is to document from which files in formatting

        during parsing to NeXus.

        experiment or students who performed simulations to name but a few.
        Adding multiple users if relevant is recommended.
        
        The protection of personal data by laws is in different stages of development
        and strictness. Therefore, the existence of user data has not been made
        required.
        
        Instances should use user as a name prefix.

    sample(NXsample):
      exists: ['min', '1', 'max', 'unbounded']
      doc:
      - |
        A physical entity which contains material intended to be investigated.
        Sample and specimen are treated as de facto synonyms. Samples can be real or virtual ones.
      - |
        There are at least two strategies how to store (meta)data when one analyzes multiple
        samples - not different ROIs on a single sample though - in one session.
      - |
        One strategy is to store each sample and its results under an own NXem/ENTRY.
        This is one of the most frequent use cases as during most sessions typically only a
        single sample is investigated. In this case the name of this group should be NXem/ENTRY/sample.
      - |
        If multiple samples are investigated storing each of them in an own ENTRY group eventually will
        demand an unnecessary duplication though of many details about the instrument.
      - |
        This can be avoided by using another strategy how to store all samples and their results.
        Namely, by using only one instance of NXem/ENTRY. That NXem/ENTRY should then be named,
        like in the previous case, NXem/entry1 and the samples should be named sample1, sample2, etc.,
        i.e. instances should use sample as a name prefix.
      - |
        In this case though the collection of events demands to use identifier_sample to state clearly
        for which of the samples loaded the (characterization) event was detected.

      identifier_sample(NX_CHAR):
        exists: recommended
        doc: |
          Ideally, (globally) unique persistent identifier which distinguishes this sample from all others
          and especially the predecessor/origin from where that sample was cut.  The terms sample
          and specimen are here considered as exact synonyms.
          
          This field must not be used for an alias for the sample! Instead, use name.
          
          In cases where multiple specimens were loaded into the microscope, the identifier has to resolve
          the specific sample, whose results are stored by this :ref:`NXentry` instance because a single
          NXentry should be used for the characterization of a single specimen.
          
          Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in resources referring to identifier_parent.
        \@type(NX_CHAR):
      identifier_parent(NX_CHAR):
        exists: recommended
        doc: |
          Identifier of the sample from which the sample was cut or the string *None*,
          i.e. the parent to this sample.
          
          The purpose of this field is to support functionalities for tracking
          sample provenance in a research data management system.
        \@type(NX_CHAR):
      preparation_date(NX_DATE_TIME):
        doc: |
          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          when the specimen was prepared.
          
          Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known timestamp when
          the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Ideally, this matches
          the last timestamp that is mentioned in the digital resource pointed to by
          identifier_parent.
          
          Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially
          required for material that is sensitive to the environment such as specimens that were
          charged with fast diffusing elements or short-lived radioactive tracers.
          
          Additional time stamps prior to preparation_date should better be placed in resources
          which describe but do not pollute the description here with prose. Resolving these
          connected metadata is considered as within the responsibility of the
          research data management system and not the a NeXus file.
      name(NX_CHAR):
        exists: recommended
        doc: |
          An alias used to refer to the specimen to please readability for humans.

        doc: |
          List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table that are contained in the sample.
          If the sample substance has multiple components, all elements from each component
          must be included in atom_types.
          
          The purpose of the field is to offer research data management systems an opportunity
          to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret these from the resources
          pointed to by identifier_parent or walk through eventually deeply nested groups in
          individual data instances.
      thickness(NX_NUMBER):
        exists: optional
        unit: NX_LENGTH
        doc: |
          (Measured) sample thickness.
          
          The information is recorded to qualify if the beam used was likely
          able to shine through the specimen. For scanning electron microscopy,
          in many cases the specimen is typically thicker than what is
          illuminatable by the electron beam.
          
          In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of the specimen
          viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal surface normal of the
          specimen is parallel to the optical axis.

          For multi-layered specimens this field should only be used to describe
          the density of the excited volume. For scanning electron microscopy
          the usage of this field is discouraged and instead an instance of a region-of-interest within connection to individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
          instances can provide a cleaner description of the relevant details
          why one may wish to store the density of the specimen.

          Description of the volume of interaction between of particle-matter interaction.
          
          Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
          interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
          the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
          or single-particle-resolved sets of trajectories.
          
          Explicit or implicit descriptions of the geometry of this
          interaction volume are possible:
          
          * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
            represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
          * An explicit description is via iso-contour surface using either
            a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
            iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
            Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle flux through
            an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface) or energy-levels
            (e.g. the case of X-rays). Details depend on the model.
          * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
            be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
          
          Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
          is available in the literature for example:
          
          * `S. Richter et al. <https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/109/1/012014>`_
          * `J. Bünger et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927622000083>`_
          * `J. F. Ziegler et al. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-68779-2_5>`_

#                 A physical entity which contains material intended to be investigated.
#                 Sample and specimen are treated as de facto synonyms. Samples can be real or virtual ones.
#                 
#                 There are at least two strategies how to store (meta)data when one analyzes multiple
#                 samples - not different ROIs on a single sample though - in one session.
#                 
#                 One strategy is to store each sample and its results under an own NXem/ENTRY.
#                 This is one of the most frequent use cases as during most sessions typically only a
#                 single sample is investigated. In this case the name of this group should be NXem/ENTRY/sample.
#                
#                 If multiple samples are investigated storing each of them in an own ENTRY group eventually will
#                 demand an unnecessary duplication though of many details about the instrument.
#                 
#                 This can be avoided by using another strategy how to store all samples and their results.
#                 Namely, by using only one instance of NXem/ENTRY. That NXem/ENTRY should then be named,
#                 like in the previous case, NXem/entry1 and the samples should be named sample1, sample2, etc.,
#                 i.e. instances should use sample as a name prefix.
#                 
#                 In this case though the collection of events demands to use identifier_sample to state clearly
#                 for which of the samples loaded the (characterization) event was detected.
#                 
#                 This concept is related to term `Specimen`_ of the EMglossary standard.

#                     the density of the excited volume. For scanning electron microscopy
#                     the usage of this field is discouraged and instead an instance of a region-of-interest within connection to individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
#                     instances can provide a cleaner description of the relevant details
#                     why one may wish to store the density of the specimen.

#                     Description of the volume of interaction between of particle-matter interaction.
#                     
#                     Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
#                     interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
#                     the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
#                     or single-particle-resolved sets of trajectories.
#                     
#                     Explicit or implicit descriptions of the geometry of this
#                     interaction volume are possible:
#                     
#                     * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
#                       represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
#                     * An explicit description is via iso-contour surface using either
#                       a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
#                       iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
#                       Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle flux through
#                       an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface) or energy-levels
#                       (e.g. the case of X-rays). Details depend on the model.
#                     * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
#                       be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
#                     
#                     Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
#                     is available in the literature for example:
#                     
#                     * `S. Richter et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/109/1/012014&gt;`_
#                     * `J. Bünger et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927622000083&gt;`_
