  Application definition for normalized representation of electron microscopy research.
  
  This application definition is a comprehensive example for a general description
  with which to normalize specific pieces of information and data collected within
  electron microscopy research.
  
  NXem is designed to be used for documenting experiments or computer simulations in which
  controlled electron beams are used for studying electron-beam matter interaction to explore
  physical mechanisms and phenomena, or to characterize materials.

          A collection of all programs and libraries which are considered relevant
          to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
          generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
          
          Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
          instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
          also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific
          set of base classes, application definitions, and  contributed definitions
          with which the here described concepts can be resolved.

        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier for referring to this experiment.
        
        An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
        in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an experiment
        (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment: *a test done in order to find out
        something, eg if an idea is correct*).
        
        The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory, or the principle investigator.
        The identifier enables to link experiments/simulations to e.g. proposals.

    experiment_description(NX_CHAR):
      exists: optional
      doc: |
        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
        by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
        into this field.
        
        The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
        The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn in how far the
        current base classes need extension based on user feedback.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
        when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
        codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
        for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
        duration is not relevant - this start_time field should be used.
        
        Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both a start_time
        and an end_time because this enables software tools and users to collect a
        more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
        
        Users should be aware though that even with having both time instances
        specified, it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or
        for how long data were acquired.
        
        More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
        to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
        advantage of individual time stamps start_time and end_time
        in :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      exists: recommended
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included when
        the microscope session ended. See docstring of the start_time field
        to see how the start_time and end_time should be used together.

      doc: |
        Possibility to store a collection of serialized resources that are associated
        with the experiment. An example how to use this set could be to document
        from which files, which have been e.g. generated by software of technology
        partners, the information in an instance of NXem was filled with.
        
        If resources from technology partners would also be documented with semantic
        technology there would not even be a necessity to copy over specific information
        into other files as one could write inference and information/fact/knowledge retrieval
        algorithm(s) whereby a specific piece of information that is related to an experiment
        or simulation is read directly from the respective file of the technology partner.
        
        The reason why currently this works convincingly in hardly any research data
        management system (RDMS) is the strong heterogeneity of the information contained
        in such files and the fact that often context and documentation, specifically
        rich semantic documentation, and contextualization is missing.

          and specimen are here considered as exact synonyms.
          
          This field must not be used for an alias! Instead, use name.
          
          In cases where multiple specimens were loaded into the microscope, the identifier has to resolve
          the specific sample, whose results are stored by this :ref:`NXentry` instance because a single
          NXentry should be used for the characterization of a single specimen.
          
          Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in resources referring to parent_identifier.

          Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known timestamp when
          the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Ideally, this matches
          the last timestamp that is mentioned in the digital resource pointed to by
          parent_identifier.
          
          Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially
          required for environmentally sensitive material such as specimen charged with hydrogen
          or experiments including tracers that have a short halflife. Additional time stamps
          prior to preparation_date should better be placed in resources which describe but
          which do not pollute the description here with prose. Resolving these connected
          pieces of information is considered the responsibility of the
          research data management system not of a NeXus file.

          The purpose of the field is to offer research data management systems an opportunity

          The information is recorded to qualify if the beam used was likely
          able to shine through the specimen. For scanning electron microscopy,
          in many cases the specimen is typically thicker than what is
          illuminatable by the electron beam.
          
          In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of
          the specimen viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal
          surface normal of the specimen is parallel to the optical axis.

# finally an example how to map e.g. a simple flat schema to NXem:
# https://www.zenodo.org/record/6513745, source path mapped on (->) target path
# for all source paths /SEM/ is the src path prefix
# for all target paths /entry1/ is the trg path prefix
# ID -> experiment_identifier
# External/alias ID -> none
# User -> map on NXuser instances
# Date -> use start_time and end_time respectively
# Affiliation -> map on NXuser instances
# DOIs -> none, map on NXcite instances
# Temperature (of what?) -> be more specific and add as property of group of relevance
# Relative humidity (of what? likely lab like temperature) -> NXsample
# Environmental gas -> NXsample
# Operator -> map on NXuser with specific role
# Instrument ID -> map on best matching field from NXfabrication in em_lab
# Sample ID -> NXsample/identifier
# Parent sample ID -> NXsample/sample_history
# Any dataset to be linked with this experiment (too vague for the I in FAIR) -> none
# Environmental protection during sample processing -> NXsample
# Pre-treatment -> own appdef and connect to NXsample/sample_history
# Measurement position (the example is totally unclear) -> NXstage_lab, coordinate system etc.
# Detector IDs -> NXdetector/identifier
# Accelerating voltage -> electron_source/voltage
# Current -> much more possibilities electron_source and NXoptical_system_em
# Magnification -> use NXoptical_system_em
# Image width -> implicit in roi/NXdata instances
# Image size -> see image width
# Acquisition mode (too vague) -> map on more expressive fields of NXem
# Storage tilt (what is this) for tilt see NXstage_lab
# Measurement date (how is it different from Date?
# Comments -> any of the description fields, in both cases not fair
# the respective TEM group has pixel coordinates, which is all much cleaner
# described using NXem_conventions, NXcoordinate_system, etc...
