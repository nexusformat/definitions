  A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.
  
  This first version originates from NXoptical_spectroscopy to describe
  cryostate windows and possible influences for ellipsometry measurements.
  
  For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
  etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
  direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
  window) (looking from the sample).
  
  The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
  measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
  a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
  in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
  performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference measurements should be
  considered as a separate experiment (with a separate NeXus file), and
  the reference data shall be :ref:`linked <Design-Links>` in
  ``reference_data_link``.
  
  The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
  beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
  defined by the 'depends_on' field.

          have been conducted as close in time to the actual measurement
          as possible.
