# key points to keep in mind when thinking about a general enough description for coarse-graining systems of atoms into
# so-called microstructural features of interest for which we may store also thermodynamic properties or other feature-specific descriptors
# several viewpoints how to coarse-grain are equally justified: grains are useful when there are crystallites with adjoining interfaces and #   none, or only some statistical populations of defects and/or some spatially-well defined defects inside these
# however, if grains are build almost only from defects like dislocation walls, it might no longer be useful to define the grains
# as a well identifiable region whose majority volume shows long-range atomic periodicity (so that defining an orientation makes) sense.
# one could then rather describe the set of defects. Alternatively one could describe a material volume by sampling individual so-called
# material points (e.g. in continuum-scale plasticity models) or describe the material volume really from the atoms up
# but there are many terms used in materials engineering which people may want to distinguish which stand however between the scales e.g.
# lattice curvature, this is jargon with some truth in it but curvature has to be build from atoms and defects need to build the curvature
# dislocations are another good example where different research questions demand differently granularized descriptions e.g.
# average density, total line length, per character, per family, line length, curvature, jog, kink density,
# coarse-grainable structural motifs in the dislocation core, atomic structure
# also different scales one would like to distinguish as this is relevant when defects couple/show spatiotemporal correlations
# to specific mechanisms (e.g. phonons) or when defect affect the properties of other defects
# ambiguous choices: is the grain boundary part of the grain or is it an own defect?
# i.e. can/should we store grains as childs of their grain boundary set vs the interface the childs of the grains?
# Depending on the use case we need to have a flexible description which can address a continuum of descriptors:
# important is that one can logically map different features
# Length scale of homogeneity: With the reality of a multi-parameter space of all possible methods and effects and
# different external stimuli applied for real materials, simulations in computational materials science typically focus
# their analysis on a few individual, spatiotemporally constrained effects and boundary conditions for which the simulation
# is formulated, useful, interpretable, and comparable to experiment.
# Data structures for multi-scale materials modeling IMM/ICME are currently diverse because they reflect the above-mentioned needs
# and different views which researchers have on their simulations e.g. DFT (time, length-scale, which electronic effects)
# RVE annealing phenomena at the micrometer scale (pressure, temperature, length scale, interactions considered or not)
# Some regions are well separated spatially (although it can be non-trivial to quantify the distance in a multi-dim parameter space)
# Some simulations are cross-scale (classical MD at the cutting edge with micrometer crystal plasticity microsecond and/or annealing at
# ns time scale) MD with classical vs abinitio-informed potential for studying evolution of mechanisms and phenomena at different length scales

        Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the
        respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
        of this application definition rather than write details about the
        experiment into this free-text description field.

        Specify if the (characterization) results/data of this instance of an
        application definition are based on the results of a simulation or the
        results of a post-processing of measured data to describe
        a microstructure.
        
        The term microstructure is used to describe the spatial arrangement of
        crystal defects inside a sample/specimen without demanding necessarily
        that this structure is mainly at the micron length scale.
        Nanostructure and macrostructure are close synonyms.
        Material architecture is a narrow synonym.
        
        Given that microstructure simulations nowadays more and more consider
        the atomic arrangement, this application definition can also be used
        to describe features at the scale of atoms.

              A typical example for MD simulations is to have one
              ms_feature_set for the atoms which is the parent to another
              ms_feature_set for monomers/molecules/proteins which is then the
              parent to another ms_feature_set for the secondary, another feature_set
              for the tertiary, and the parent for another feature_set for the
              quaternary structure.
              
              Another typical example from materials engineering is to have
              one ms_feature_set for crystals (grains/phases) which serves as
              the parent to another ms_feature_set for interfaces between these
              crystals which then is the parent for another ms_feature_set to
              describe the triple junctions which is then the parent for the
              quadruple/higher-order junctions between which connect the
              triple lines.
              
              Another example from discrete dislocation dynamics could be to
              have one ms_feature_set for the dislocations (maybe separate
              sets for each dislocation type or family) which are then
              parents to other ms_feature_set which describe junctions between
              dislocations or features along the dislocation line network.
