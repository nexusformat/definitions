  Base class for components used in an electron microscope.
  
  The electron microscope can be a real one or a simulated microscope.
  The key motivation behind this generalization is the observation that in all
  cases a controlled electron beam is generated in reality or that beam is simulated
  and this beam is then used or modified in a controlled manner for the purpose
  of studying physical interaction mechanisms of the beam with matter.
  Here it does not matter whether one considers a real specimen or a simulated one.
  
  Using a common description for the real experiment in the lab and - what is
  typically a simplification of it - via a computer simulation, has the benefit
  that many pieces of information can be stored in the same way. In effect,
  users are guided with finding information and unnecessary descriptive
  variety for what are exactly the same concept is avoided to work towards
  more interoperability.
  
  Another motivation to make no fundamental distinction between a scanning and
  a transmission electron microscope is that both are electron microscopes whose
  components are often very similar.

      Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier, link, or text to a
      resource which gives further details to this component.
      If such resource does not exist, a free-text field to report
      further details about the component is possible.
