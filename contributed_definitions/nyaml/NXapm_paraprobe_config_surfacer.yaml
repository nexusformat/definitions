        preprocessing_method:
          doc: |
            Specifies the method that is used to preprocess the point cloud.
            The main purpose of this setting is to specify whether the point
            cloud should be segmented or not during the preprocessing
            to identify which points are more likely lying close to the edge
            of the point cloud. These points could be more relevant than the
            interior points for certain alpha-shape constructions.
            
            By default no such filtering is used during pre-processing.
            By contrast, the option kuehbach activates a preprocessing
            during which a Hoshen-Kopelman percolation analysis is used
            to identify which points are closer to the edge of the dataset.
            This can reduce the number of points in the alpha-shape
            computation and thus improve performance substantially.
            Details about the methods are reported in 
            `M. Kühbach et al. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00486-1>`_.

            When using the kuehbach preprocessing, this is the width of the
            kernel for identifying which ions are in voxels close to the
            edge of the point cloud.

        alpha_value_choice:
          doc: |
            Specifies which method to use to define the alpha value.
            The value convex_hull_naive is the default. This instructs the tool
            to use a fast specialized algorithm for computing only the convex
            hull. The resulting triangles can be skinny.
            
            The value convex_hull_refine computes first also a convex_hull_naive
            but refines the mesh by triangle flipping and splitting to improve
            the quality of the mesh.
            
            The value smallest_solid instructs the CGAL library to choose a
            value which realizes an alpha-shape that is the smallest solid.
            
            The value cgal_optimal instructs the library to choose a value
            which the library considers as an optimal value. Details are
            define in the respective section of the CGAL library on 3D alpha
            shapes.
            
            The value set_of_values instructs to compute a list of
            alpha-shapes for the specified alpha-values.
            
            The value set_of_alpha_wrappings instructs the library to generate
            a set of so-called alpha wrappings. These are a method
            which is similar to alpha shapes but provide additional guarantees
            though such as watertightness and proximity constraints on the
            resulting wrapping.
