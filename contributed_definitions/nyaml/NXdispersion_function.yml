  This describes a dispersion function for a material or layer
symbols:
  n_repetitions: |
    The number of repetitions for the repeated parameters
NXdispersion_function:
  model_name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      The name of this dispersion model.
  formula(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      This should be a python parsable function.
      Here we should provide which keywords are available
      and a BNF of valid grammar.
  convention(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      The sign convention being used (n + or - ik)
    enumeration: ["n + ik", "n - ik"]
  energy_identifier(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      The identifier used to represent energy
      in the formula. It is recommended to use `E`.
  energy_min(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The minimum energy value at which this formula is valid.
    unit: NX_ENERGY
  energy_max(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The maximum energy value at which this formula is valid.
    unit: NX_ENERGY
  energy_unit(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The energy unit used in the formula.
      The field value is a scaling factor for the units attribute.
      It is recommeded to set the field value to 1 and carry all the unit
      scaling information in the units attribute.
    unit: NX_ENERGY
  wavelength_identifier(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      The identifier useed to represent wavelength
      in the formula. It is recommended to use `lambda`.
  wavelength_unit(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The wavelength unit used in the formula.
      The field value is a scaling factor for the units attribute.
      It is recommeded to set the field value to 1 and carry all the unit
      scaling information in the units attribute.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  wavelength_min(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The minimum wavelength value at which this formula is valid.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  wavelength_max(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The maximum wavelength value at which this formula is valid.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  representation(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Which representation does the formula evaluate to.
      This may either be n for refractive index or eps for dielectric function.
      The appropriate token is then to be used inside the formula.
    enumeration: [n, eps]
  (NXdispersion_single_parameter):
  (NXdispersion_repeated_parameter):
    parameter_units:
      dimensions:
        rank: 1
        dim: [[1, n_repetitions]]
    values(NX_NUMBER):
      dimensions:
        rank: 1
        dim: [[1, n_repetitions]]
