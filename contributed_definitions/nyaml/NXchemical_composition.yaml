    doc: |
      Reporting compositions as atom and weight percent yields both
      dimensionless quantities but their conceptual interpretation differs.
      A normalization based on atom_percent counts relative to the
      total number of atoms which are of a particular type.
      By contrast, weight_percent normalization factorizes in the
      respective mass of the elements. Software libraries that work with units
      (like pint in Python) are challenged by these differences as at.-% and
      wt.-% are both fractional quantities.
    enumeration: [atom_percent, weight_percent]
  total(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS

      Total based on which composition information is normalized.

    count(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
      doc: |
        Count or weight which, when divided by total yields the composition
        of this element, isotope, molecule, or ion.

    composition(NX_FLOAT):
      unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
      doc: |
        Composition value for the element/ion referred to under name.
        Composition is reported either normalized for atomic or weight
        percent. The field normalization should be used to communicate
        this explicitly. Composition should be reported consistently
        for all instances ELEMENT.
    composition_error(NX_FLOAT):
      exists: recommended
      unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
      doc: |
        Magnitude of the standard deviation of the composition.
