  Application definition for results files of the paraprobe-transcoder tool.
  
  This tool is part of the paraprobe-toolbox. Inspect the base class :ref:`NXapm_paraprobe_tool_results`.
  The purpose and need of the paraprobe-transcoder tool is to create a standardized representation
  of reconstructed position and mass-to-charge-state-ratio values surplus other pieces of information
  to enable working with atom probe data in reconstruction space.
  This includes ranging definitions which map mass-to-charge-state ratio values onto iontypes.
  So far the atom probe community has not yet agreed upon a comprehensive standardization for 
  information exchange especially when it comes to the communication of configurations and results
  from analyses of atom probe data. Instead, different simplistic file formats are used, such as POS,
  ePOS, APT, or RNG and RRNG. None of these formats, though, document the provenance of, and thus the
  sequence in which certain analysis steps were performed or which specific input and
  configuration was used.
  
  Paraprobe-transcoder solves this limitation by interpreting the information content in such files
  and standardize the representation prior injection into the scientific data analysis tools of the toolbox.
  Therefore, the here proposed set of NeXus base classes and application definitions can be a useful
  starting point that enable the atom probe community to take advantage of standardized information
  exchange and improve the here proposed classes and concepts to become more inclusive.
  
  Paraprobe-transcoder uses a Python library developed based on efforts by members of the
  global atom probe community `International Field Emission Society (IFES) Atom Probe Technical Committee (APT TC) <https://www.github.com/atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling>`_. This library offers the
  actual low-level I/O operations and respective information interpretation.
