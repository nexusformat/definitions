  (NXfabrication):
  description:
    doc: |
      Free-text field to specify further details about the reflectron.
      The field can be used to inform e. g. if the reflectron is flat or curved.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Affine transformation(s) which detail where the reflectron
      is located relative to e.g. the origin of the specimen space
      reference coordinate system.
      This group can also be used for specifying how the reflectron
      is rotated relative to the specimen axis.
      The purpose of these more detailed instrument descriptions
      is to support the creation of a digital twin of the instrument
      for computational science.
