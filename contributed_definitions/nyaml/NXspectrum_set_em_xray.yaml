  Container for reporting a set of energy-dispersive X-ray spectra.
  
  Virtually the most important case is that spectra are collected in 
  a scanning microscope (SEM or STEM) for a collection of points.
  The majority of cases use simple d-dimensional regular scan pattern,
  such as single point, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
  The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
  
  For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
  binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
  
  `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation <https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308>`_
  should be used.
# NEW ISSUE: use computational geometry to offer arbitrary scan pattern
# NEW ISSUE: make the binning flexible per scan point
symbols:
# n_p: Number of scan points
  n_y: Number of pixel per X-ray mapping in the slow direction
  n_x: Number of pixel per X-ray mapping in the fast direction
  n_photon_energy: Number of X-ray photon energy (bins)
  n_elements: Number of identified elements
  n_peaks: Number of peaks
