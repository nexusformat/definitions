  Description of an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.

  Details of an `electro-magnetic lens`_.

  For NXtransformations the origin of the coordinate system is placed
  in the center of the lens (its polepiece, pinhole, or another point of
  reference. The origin should be specified in the NXtransformations.
