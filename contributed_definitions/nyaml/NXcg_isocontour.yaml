  Computational geometry description of isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.
  
  Iso-contouring algorithms such as MarchingCubes and others are frequently
  used to segment d-dimensional regions into regions where intensities are
  lower or higher than a threshold value, the so-called isovalue.
  
  Frequently in computational materials science phase-field methods are
  used which generate data on discretized grids. Isocontour algorithms
  are often used in such context to pinpoint the locations of microstructural
  features from this implicit phase-field-variable-based description.
  
  One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
  for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed matter physicists,
  and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field simulation
  data could be described with NeXus, provided base classes such as the this one
  get further extend according to the liking of the phase-field community.
