  As a starting point, we follow the conventions of the CGAL library.
# weighted alpha shapes
# The so-called spectrum or sets of (weighted) alpha shapes includes the
# convex hull of a point set.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: The dimensionality of the alpha shape, for now 2 or 3.
  # generalize to d > 3
  n_e: The number of edges.
  n_f: The number of faces.
  n_c: The number of cells.
NXcg_alpha_complex:
  dimensionality(NX_UINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    enumeration: [2, 3]
  type:
    doc: |
      Specify which general type of alpha shape is computed.
      Using for now the CGAL terminology. Basic means (unweighted) alpha shapes.
      Alpha_wrapping means meshes created using alpha wrapping procedures.
    enumeration: [convex_hull, alpha_shape, alpha_wrapping] # , weighted]
  mode:
    doc: |
      Specifically when computed with the CGAL, the mode specifies if singular 
      faces are removed (regularized) of the alpha complex.
    # CHECK THIS AGAIN CAREFULLY
    enumeration: [general, regularized]
  alpha(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The alpha, (radius of the alpha-sphere) parameter to be used for alpha
      shapes and alpha wrappings.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  offset(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The offset distance parameter to be used in addition to alpha
      in the case of alpha_wrapping.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    # check again carefully the CGAL documentation talks about, for 3D, the square of the radius!
  point_set(NXcg_point_set):
    doc: Point cloud for which the alpha shape or wrapping should be computed.
  # this could also just be implemented as a link but how would this be possible
  # unfold the NXcg_point_set and add a 
  # weight(NX_NUMBER):
  #   doc: Weights for each point
  # In general, an alpha complex is a disconnected and non-pure complex, 
  # meaning in particular that the alpha complex may have singular faces.
  # so the number of cells, faces and edges depends on how a specific alpha complex,
  # i.e. an alpha-shape of S for alpha, is filtrated with respect to k < d-dimensional
  # simplices. Here we assume that number_of_cells, number_of_faces, number_of_edges
  # are reported assuming one filtrates these simplices according to mode.
  # also using the assumption the base class reports the unique vertices
  # of the specifically filtrated alpha complex.
  triangle_set(NXcg_triangle_set):
    doc: Triangle soup for which the alpha wrapping should be computed.
  triangulation(NXcg_triangle_set):
    doc: A meshed representation of the resulting shape.
  # should be a mesh
  # add for each triangle if desirable a notation of whether the simplex is
  # exterior, regular, singular, or interior with respect to the alpha complex
  # but a triangulation is more than a triangle (soup)/set because there is
  # connectivity information
  # customize the NXcg_triangle_set base class members such that connectivity
  # information is contained
  # we need to find also a better name for this, what people intutive understand
  # as the interior, may not even exist for a given alpha value
  # more specifically it is the set of filtrated cells acknowledging mode
  # e.g. the interior cells of the regularized alpha complex
