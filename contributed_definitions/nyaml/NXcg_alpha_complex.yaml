  in CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library respectively.
  As a starting point, we follow the conventions of the CGAL library.
  
  In general, an alpha complex is a not necessarily connected or not necessarily pure complex,
  i.e. singular faces may exist. The number of cells, faces, and edges depends on how a specific
  alpha complex is filtered for lower-dimensional simplices. The fields is_regularized and
  regularization can be used to provide details about regularization procedures.

# The so-called spectrum or sets of (weighted) alpha shapes includes the convex hull of a point set.
