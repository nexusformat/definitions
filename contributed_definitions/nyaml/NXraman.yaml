      This is the application definition describing Raman spectroscopy experiments.
      
      Such experiments may be as simple a single Raman spectrum from spontanous
      Raman scattering and range to Raman imaging Raman spectrometer,
      surface- and tip-enhanced Raman techniques, x-Ray Raman scattering, as well
      as resonant Raman scattering phenomena or multidimenional Raman spectra (i.e.
      varying temperature, pressure, electric field, ....)
      
      The application definition defines:
      
      * elements of the experimental instrument
      * calibration information if available
      * parameters used to tune the state of the sample
      * sample description
