  An application definition for Raman spectrocopy experiments.
  
  Such experiments may be as simple a single Raman spectrum from spontanous
  Raman scattering and range to Raman imaging Raman spectrometer,
  surface- and tip-enhanced Raman techniques, x-Ray Raman scattering, as well
  as resonant Raman scattering phenomena or multidimenional Raman spectra (i.e.
  varying temperature, pressure, electric field, ....)
  
  The application definition contains two things:
  1. The structures in the application definition of NXopt:
  * Instrument and data calibrations
  * Sensors for sample or beam conditions
    
  AND

  2. The strucutres specified and extended in NXraman:
  * description of the experiment type
  * descroption of the setup's meta data and optical elements (source, monochromator, detector, waveplate, lens, etc.)
  * description of beam properties and their relations to the sample
  * sample information

    Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.
  N_spectrum: |
    Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured
    data.
  N_measurements: |
    Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is
    equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment
    was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures
    N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.
  N_detection_angles: |
    Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the
    sample.
  N_incident_angles: |
    Number of angles of incidence of the incident beam.
  N_scattering_configurations: |
    Number of scattering configurations used in the measurement.
    It is 1 for only parallel polarization meausement, 2 for parallel and cross 
    polarization measurement or larger, if i.e. the incident and scattered photon
    direction is varied.
  #N_incident_wavelengths: |

# A draft version of a NeXus application definition for Raman spectroscopy.

# 09/2024
# TODO (Workshop output):
# - Talk with VIBSO people - possible to syncrhonize raman_experiment_type with this ontology?
# - Similar to ellipsometry: Seperate in-situ from resonant/non-resonant stuff: OR maybe allow multiple selections?
# - Shorten raman_experiment_type by removal of Raman_spectroscopy, but as well fix the Raman Reader in the same run
# - Which for more dataconverters: Output from usualy Raman setups to neXus format?
# - Spot size description?
# - Descroption of defocusing / maybe as well as experiment_type?
#
# Wishes for NXraman or general next workshop:
# "convert excisting data to NeXus"
# "dictionary lookup keywords/fields in existing formats"(?)
# Template for specific experiments (i.e. too complex to get into NeXus/FAIRdata?) - unclear what to do.
# coorporation with VIBSO ontology?
# dataset examples (i.e. NXdata_raman)
