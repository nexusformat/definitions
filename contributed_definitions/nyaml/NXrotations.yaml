  Base class to detail a set of rotations, orientations, and disorientations.
  
  For getting a more detailed insight into the discussion of the
  parameterized description of orientations in materials science see:

  Once orientations are defined, one can continue to characterize the
  misorientation and specifically the disorientation. The misorientation describes
  the rotation that is required to register the lattices of two oriented objects
  (like crystal lattice) into a crystallographic equivalent orientation:

NXrotations(NXobject):
  reference_frame(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Reference to an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` which contextualizes
      how the here reported parameterized quantities can be interpreted.
  crystal_symmetry(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal.
      
      This has to be at least a single string. If crystal_symmetry is not
      provided, point group 1 is assumed.
      
      In the case that misorientation or disorientation fields are used
      and the two crystal sets resolve for phases with a different
      crystal symmetry, this field needs to encode two strings:
      The first string is for phase A. The second string is for phase B.
      An example of this most complex case is the description of the
      disorientation between crystals adjoining a hetero-phase boundary.
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: (n_phases,)
  sample_symmetry(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing
      the material/sample which could give rise to or may justify to use a
      simplified description of rotations, orientations, misorientations,
      and disorientations via numerical procedures that are known as
      symmetrization.
      
      If sample_symmetry is not provided, point group 1 is assumed.
      
      The traditionally used symmetrization operations within the texture
      community in Materials Science, though, have become obsolete thanks
      to improvements in methods, software, and available computing power.
      
      Therefore, users are encouraged to set the sample_symmetry to 1 (triclinic).
      
      In practice one often faces situations where indeed these assumed
      symmetries are anyway not fully observed, and thus an accepting of
      eventual inaccuracies just for the sake of reporting a simplified
      symmetrized description should be avoided.

    doc: |
      The set of rotations expressed in Euler angle parameterization considering
      the same applied symmetries as detailed for the field rotation_quaternion.
      To interpret Euler angles correctly, it is necessary to inspect the rotation
      conventions behind reference_frame to resolve which of the many possible
      Euler-angle conventions (Bunge ZXZ, XYZ, Kocks, Tait, etc.) were used.
