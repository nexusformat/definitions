  State of a container holding the sample under investigation.
  
  A container is any object in the beam path which absorbs the beam and
  whose contribution to the overall attenuation/scattering needs to be
  determined to process the experimental data. Examples of containers
  include glass capillary tubes, vanadium cans, windows in furnaces or
  diamonds in a Diamond Anvil Cell. The following figures show a complex
  example of a container':'

     A hypothetical capillary furnace. The beam passes from left to right
     (blue dashes), passing through window 1, then window 2, before
     passing through the downstream wall of the capillary. It is then
     scattered by the sample with scattered beams passing through the
     upstream wall of the capillary, then windows 4 and 5. As part of the
     corrections for a PDF experiment it is necessary to subtract the PDF
     of the empty container (i.e. each of the windows and the capillary).
     To calculate the PDF of the empty container it is necessary to have
     the measured scattering data and to know the nature (e.g. density,
     elemental composition, etc.) of the portion of the container which
     the beam passed through.

     A complete description of the shapes of the container elements with
     their orientation relative to the beam and also information on
     whether they are upstream or downstream of the sample is also
     therefore important. For example, although the windows 2 and 4 have
     the same shape, the path taken through them by the beam is very
     different and this needs to be modelled. Furthermore, it is not
     inconceivable that windows might move during an experiment and thus
     the changes to the beampath would need to be accounted for.
  
  This class encodes the position of the container with respect to the
  sample and allows the calculation of the beampath through the container.
  It also includes sufficient data to model beam absorption of the
  container and a link to a dataset containing a measurement of the
  container with nothing inside, to allow data corrections (at a specific
  beam energy/measurement time) to be made.
