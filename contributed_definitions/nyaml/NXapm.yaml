      doc: |
        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
        respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
        of this application definition rather than write details about the
        experiment into this free-text description field.

      exists: recommended
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information

        If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
        application definition should only be used for specifying when the
        experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
        - this start time field should be used.
        
        Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
        both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
        and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
        even with having both dates specified, it may not be possible
        to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
        were collected.
        
        More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
        collected to compute this event chain during the experiment.
      #  These computations can take advantage of individual time stamps
      #  in NXevent_em instances to provide additional pieces of information.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      exists: recommended
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included
        when the microscope session ended.
    # NEW ISSUE: fields like duration need a clearer description as to how these quantities should be defined. Most atom probers do not care for this other than getting an approximate hour-accurate estimate of the time how long it took to evaporate the specimen.
    program:
      doc: |
       Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
       to create the original results file of the atom probe experiment.
       This file and program should not be confused with downstream
       processing operations and file format conversion tasks.
       
       Atom probe microscopy experiments are except for still very much cases
       controlled via commercial software. Such software is designed as an
       integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
       
       For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the
       least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored
       in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary and the
       specifications of which are not publicly documented.
       
       Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected
       to the instrument control software and synced with the experiment
       while signal is being detected. In effect, RHIT and HITS files
       store the (rawest) experiment data in a closed manner that is
       practically useless for users unless they have access to the
       commercial software.
       
       To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy (APM) with LEAP instruments
       delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
       position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
       analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
       necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
       the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
       processing steps have to be stored.
       
       With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
       (on the detector) and calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
       quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
       ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.
       
       In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
       via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
       and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. This is post-processing
       even though in practice it is performed sometimes already (as preview)
       already while data are still being collected.
       
       The ion types decode molecular identities which can very often be
       mapped to elemental identities, and also to resolve isotopes.
       All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software.
       
       Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
       (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
       not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
       for the early stage data acquisition and processing stages to obtain
       a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset.
       
       Therefore, this application definition documents not only the measurement
       but also the key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary
       data into a tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.
       
       Future guidance by the vendors could improve this description to cover
       a substantial larger number of eventually metadata that so far
       are not publicly documented and accessible in an open-source manner.

          in such a manner that the result file is ideally recreatable

        Neither the specimen_name nor the experiment_identifier but the identifier
        through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
        For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/APSuite
        run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
        Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the
        identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.
        
        As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
        It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
        while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
        needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
        We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.
        
        This application definition does currently not allow to store the
        entire set of such interrupted runs to be stored and covered. However,
        this is not because of a technical limitation within NeXus but
        because we have not seen a covering use case based on which we could
        have implemented and conceptualized this. Atom probers are invited to
        contact the respective people in the FAIRmat team to fix this.

    specimen(NXsample):
      # NEW ISSUE: inject the conclusion from the discussion with Andrea
      # according to SAMPLE.yaml 0f8df14 2022/06/15
      name:
        doc: |
          Descriptive name or ideally (globally) unique persistent identifier.
          The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially the
          predecessor/origin from where the specimen was cut.
          In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from
          samples or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple
          specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to resolve
          which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken.
          
          The user is advised to store the details how specimens were
          cut/prepared from samples in the sample history. This field must
          not be used for an alias of the specimen. Instead, use short_title.
          
          In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
          the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
          by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
          the characterization of a single specimen in a single continuous run.
          
          Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
          sample history.

          microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/
          preparation history.
          
          In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
          available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a
          sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider

          its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing
          state and details of the preparation.

          the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this
          should be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined
          handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
          the session starts.
          
          Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
          especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
          hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
          short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
          better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

        in atom probe microscopy follow.
        
        In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
        Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):
        
        * The laboratory space;  
          a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
          a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
          transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
          has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.  
        * The specimen space;  
          a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
          whose z axis points towards the detector.  
        * The detector space;  
          a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the  
          detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.  
          This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion  
          positions.  
        * The reconstruction space;  
          a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.  
          The orientation depends on the analysis software used.  
        * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
          flight path of individual ions might be defined.  
        
        Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
        Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.
        
        In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
        space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
        (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
        within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
        ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.
        
        For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
        is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
        the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
        
        The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
        the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.

        An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
        scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:
        
        * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
          (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
          and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
          microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
          and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
          Hence, there is no real probe/beam.  
        * Second, the specimen is the lens of the microscope.

          A place where details about the initial shape of the specimen
          can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution
          of the specimen can be stored. There are currently very few
          techniques which can measure the shape evolution:
          
          * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
            but this usually takes an interrupted experiment  
            in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken,  
            and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
            Examples are `I. Mouton et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161>`_  
            and `C. Fletcher <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6>`_.  
          * Another method, which is less accurate though, is to monitor  
            the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
            (if available) in the instrument.  
          * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
            methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_.  
          * A continuous monitoring of the specimen in a   
            correlative electron microscopy/atom probe experiment  
            is planned to be developed by `T. Kelly et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205>`_

          The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
          single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) <https://www.atomprobe.com>`_.
          Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
          instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).
          
          By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
          research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
          the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
          the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
          the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
          or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
          Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
          to control the instrument.
          
          Some of which are modularized and open,
          some of which realize also integrated control units with
          portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
          (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.
          
          Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
          community-specific API for getting finely granularized
          access to such control settings.
          
          These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
          application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.

            The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction is
            qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers
            or research groups.
            
            Specific differences exists though in the form of different
            calibration models. For now we do not wish to resolve or
            generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection
            is to provide a container where model-specific parameters
            and calibration models can be stored if users know these
            for sure.
            
            For AMETEK LEAP instruments this should be the place for
            storing initial calibration values. These values are
            accessible normally only by AMETEK service engineers.
            They use these for calibrating the detector and instrument.
            
            Users can also use this NXcollection for storing the
            iteratively identified calibrations which scientists
            will see displayed in e.g. APSuite while they execute
            the voltage-and-bowl correction as a part of the
            reconstruction pipeline in APSuite.
