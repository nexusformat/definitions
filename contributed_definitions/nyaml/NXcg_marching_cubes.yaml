doc: |
  Computational geometry description of the marching cubes algorithm.
  
  Documenting which specific version was used can help to understand how robust
  the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
NXcg_marching_cubes:
  grid(NXcg_grid):
    doc: |
      Reference/link to and/or details of the grid on which a specific
      marching cubes algorithm implementation is operating.
  implementation:
    doc: |
      Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.
      
      See for example the following papers for details about how to identify a
      DOI which specifies the implementation used:
      
      * `W. E. Lorensen <https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2020.2971284>`_  
      * `T. S. Newman and H. Yi <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021>`_  
      
      The value placed here should be a DOI. If there are no specific DOI or
      details write not_further_specified, or give at least a free-text
      description.
  program:
    doc: |
      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of
        an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
        and build instructions can be found so that the program can be
        configured in such a manner that the result file is ideally
        recreatable yielding the same results.
# we could also think about storing the rule sets in here explicitly including the
# coordinate system conventions; however, the problem is that many commercial
# tools like Matlab do not expose the rule set.
