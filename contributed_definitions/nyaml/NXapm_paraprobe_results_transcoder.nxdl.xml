                 On a mid term perspective we would like to evolve the paraprobe-toolbox
                 to an implementation stage where it works exclusively with completely
                 provenance-tracked formats for both the configuration of the workflow step
                 and/or analysis with each tool and also for the output of these analyses
                 in the form of so-called tool-specific results files.
                 Currently the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) is used to store such data.
                 
                 Different file formats can be used to inject reconstructed datasets and
                 ranging definitions into the toolbox. Traditionally, these are the POS, 
                 ePOS, and APT files with the tomographic reconstruction and other metadata
                 and RNG and RRNG file formats for the ranging definitions how mass-to-charge
                 state-ratio values map on (molecular) ion types. Such input should be
                 injected via specific NeXus/HDF5 files which are documented
                 in compliance with the NXapm application definition.
                 
                 So far the paraprobe-toolbox was used as a standalone tool. Therefore, it
                 was not relevant during the development to focus on interoperability.
                 Essentially paraprobe-transcoder was used as a parser to transcode data
                 in the above-mentioned file formats into a paraprobe-specific
                 representation. This transcoding should become deprecated.
                 Here we describe steps we have taken into this direction.
                 
                 With the work in the FAIRmat project and the desire to make the paraprobe-
                 toolbox also accessible as a cloud-computing capable service in the Nomad
                 Remote Tools Hub (NORTH) the topic of interoperability became more important
                 and eventually the NXapm application definition was proposed.
                 NORTH is a GUI and related service in a NOMAD OASIS instance which allows
                 to spawn preconfigured docker containers via JupyterHub.
                 Currently, NORTH includes the so-called apm container. A container with
                 tools specific for analyzing data from atom probe microscopy as well as
                 processing of point cloud and mesh data.
                 
                 The NXapm application definition and related implementation work within
                 NOMAD OASIS enabled users to parse content of POS, ePOS, APT, RNG, and
                 RRNG files, surplus key metadata from vendor-agnostic electronic lab notebook
                 solutions directly into NOMAD OASIS via the uploads section.
                 The process is automated and yields an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5 file
                 inside the uploads section in return.
                 
                 With these improvements made there is no longer a need for - at least the
                 users of a NOMAD OASIS and NORTH instance to use the deprecated 
                 PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.*.h5 files. Ideally, paraprobe should
                 automatically detect that the input can now be an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5
                 file and in response work with this file directly.
                 To remain compliant with users however who do not have or do not wish
                 to use a NOMAD OASIS or NXapm or NeXus at all right now, the solution is
                 as follows:
                 
                 Calling the configuration stage of paraprobe-transcoder is always mandatory.
                 It is always the first step of working with the toolbox. In this process
                 the user defines the input files. These can either be nxs i.e. the NXapm/NeXus/
                 HDF5 file from e.g. the upload section, or such a file that was obtained from
                 a colleague with a NOMAD OASIS instance.
                 In all other cases, users can pass the reconstruction and ranging definitions
                 using the traditional POS, ePOS, or APT and RNG or RRNG file formats respectively.
                 
                 Based on which input the user delivers, the parmsetup-transcoder tool then
                 creates a configuration file PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs and
                 informs the user whether the input was NeXus (and thus if all relevant
                 input is already available) or whether the paraprobe-transcoder tool needs
                 to be executed to convert the content of the vendor files first into a
                 format which paraprobe can provenance track and understand.
                 In the latter case, the PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file is
                 used to communicate to all subsequently used tools from which files
                 the tools can expect to find the reconstruction and ranging definitions.
                 
                 All subsequent analysis steps start also with a tool-specific configuration.
                 This configuration step reads in (among others) the
                 PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file from which the configuration
                 tool identifies automatically whether to read the reconstruction and ranging data
                 from PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.SimID.*.h5 or directly the NXapm-compliant
                 NeXus/HDF5 file that was created upon preparing the upload or the file shared
                 from a colleague. This design removes the need for unnecessary copies of the data.
                 Currently still though users should execute the transcoder step as it will
                 generate a supplementary XDMF topology field with which the data in either
                 the NeXus/HDF5 or the transcoded vendor files can be displayed using e.g.
                 Paraview. For this purpose XDMF is used.
                 
                 Of course ideally the APT community would at some point converge to use
                 a common data exchange file format. To this end, AMETEK/Cameca's APT file format
                 could be a good starting point but so far it is lacking a consistent way of
                 how to store generalized ranging definitions and post-processing results.
                 POS, ePOS, Rouen's ATO, as well as other so far used representations of data
                 like CSV or text files have, to the best of our current knowledge, no
                 concept of how to marry reconstruction and (optional) ranging data into
                 one self-descriptive format.
                 
                 This summarizes the rationale behind the current choices of the I/O for
                 paraprobe. Furthermore, this summarizes also why the fundamental design
                 of splitting an analysis always into steps of configuration (with parmsetup),
                 task execution (with the respective C/C++ or Python tool of the toolbox),
                 and post-processing (e.g. with autoreporter) is useful because it offers
                 a clear description of provenance tracking. This is a necessary step to make
                 atom probe microscopy data at all better aligned with the aims of the
                 FAIR principles.
                 
                 The internal organization of the data entries in the atom_probe group
                 in this application definition for paraprobe-transcoder results files
                 mirror the definitions of the NXapm for consistency reasons.
