doc: |
  Base class for the configuration and results from a hit finding algorithm.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_dld: |
    Number of delay-line wires of the detector.
  n_ht: |
    Number of hit qualities (hit types) distinguished.
  p: |
    Number of pulses collected in between start_time and end_time
    resolved by an instance of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm`. If this is not defined,
    p is the number of ions included in the reconstructed volume if an application
    definition is used to store results of already reconstructed datasets.

  # config/input
  number_of_dld_wires(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      The number of wires in the detector.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    enumeration: [1, 2, 3]
  dld_wire_names(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Alias tuple (begin, end) of each DLD wire of the detector.
      Order follows arrival_time_pairs.
    dim: (n_dld, 2)
  arrival_time_pairs(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Raw readings from the analog-to-digital-converter
      timing circuits of the detector wires.
    unit: NX_TIME

  # results of the hit_finding algorithm
  hit_positions(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Evaluated ion impact coordinates on the detector.
      Use the depends_on field to spec
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (p, 2)
    \@depends_on(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Reference to an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` in which the positions are defined.
  hit_quality_types(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Name of the hit_qualities distinguished.
      AMETEK/Cameca uses e.g. golden, multiple, partial,
      irrecoverable, and multi-first and multi-late.
    dim: (n_ht,)
  hit_quality_identifier(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Identifier used for each hit_quality type.
      Following the order of hit_quality_types.
  hit_quality(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Hit quality identifier for each pulse.
      Identifier have to be within hit_quality_identifier.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (p,)
  hit_multiplicity(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      This processing yields for each ion with how many others it evaporated
      if these were collected on the same pulse. Extraction of multiple ions
      on one pulse on different or even the same pixel of the detector are possible.
      
      Multiplicity must not be confused with how many atoms of the same element
      a molecular ion contains (which is instead encoded with the
      isotope_vector field of each :ref:`NXion` instance).
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (p,)
    # the following two quantities are relicts from ePOS files used to give some
    # insight into the results of the hit_finding algorithm of IVAS/APSuite but typically
    # used only in the context to learn about the multiplicity of an ion.
    # pulses_since_last_ion(NX_UINT):
