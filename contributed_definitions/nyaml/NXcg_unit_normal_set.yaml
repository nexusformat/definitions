  Computational geometry description of a set of (oriented) unit normal vectors.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of unit normals.
NXcg_unit_normal_set:
  dimensionality(NX_POSINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  cardinality(NX_POSINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  normals(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: Direction of each normal
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dimensions:
      rank: 2
      dim: [[1, c], [2, d]]
  orientation(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Qualifier how which specifically oriented normal to its primitive each
      normal represents.
      
      * 0 - undefined
      * 1 - outer
      * 2 - inner
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
