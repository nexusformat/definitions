      Triplet of the minimum, increment, and maximum value which will
      be included in the analysis. The increment controls which n-th entry to take.
      
      Take as an example a dataset with 100 entries (their indices start at zero)
      and the filter set to 0, 1, 99. This will process each entry.
      0, 2, 99 will take each second entry. 90, 3, 99 will take only each third
      entry beginning from entry 90 up to 99.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
