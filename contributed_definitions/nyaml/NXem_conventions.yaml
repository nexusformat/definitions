  Conventions for rotations and coordinate systems to interpret crystal orientation
  and other data and results collected with electron microscopy research.
  
  Documenting explicitly all used conventions and coordinate systems is
  the decisive context whereby many results from electron microscopy are
  at all interpretable.

# This base class provides several sets of such assumptions and conventions.
# Further base classes should be defined when specific techniques and methods
# demand further specifications or have specialized demands. NXem_conventions_ebsd
# is an example for such method-specific base class to summarize key conventions
# for Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD).

# What is could be a best practice for application definition developers
# who would like to describe an electron microscopy case where multiple
# methods and/or detectors are used. In this case one should define a
# method-specific base class like the template NXem_conventions_ebsd.
# Even though this may come at a cost of some duplicated information where
# the same physical detector is used in different ways, i.e. the signal collect
# from the detector is interpreted in a different way.
# As in most cases established types of signal and thus detectors are used
# (secondary electron, backscattered electron, etc.) one could equally use
# just one NXem_conventions base class instance in an application definition
# and use detector_reference_frame as a template. For each method and detector
# one then creates one NXprocess group named detector_reference_frame1,
# detector_reference_frame2, detector_reference_frame3, and so on and so forth
# and adds inside that NXprocess and use the depends_on field.

# What is considered best practice in an application definition with multiple
# NXentry instances? In this case each NXentry instance should have an own
# NXspecimen instance and thus the NXem_conventions instance should be place
# inside that NXentry. This enables to group multiple experiments on multiple
# samples together without setting a constraint that in all these instances
# the conventions have to be the same.

# However, best practice is the conventions should be expressed explicitly
# and they should whenever possible be as simple as possible and as few
# as possible to support users with understanding the content of the application
# definition.

        identifying positions on a (virtual) image which is formed by
        information collected from an electron beam scanning the
        sample surface. We assume the configuration is inspected by

        The sample surface reference frame has coordinates Xs, Ys, Zs.
        In three dimensions these coordinates are not necessarily
        located on the surface of the sample as there are multiple
        faces/sides of the sample. Most frequently though the coordinate
        system here is used to define the surface which the electron
        beam scans.
