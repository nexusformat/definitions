  Computational geometry description of a set of spheres in Euclidean space.
  
  Each sphere can have a different radius.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of circles or spheres.

  cardinality(NX_POSINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  identifier_offset(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
      identifiers for spheres. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
      or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
      interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
      For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
      
      The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
      identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
      or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

  center(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Geometric center of the spheres. This can be the center of mass.
      Dimensionality and cardinality of the point and sphere set have to match.
      The identifier_offset and identifier field of NXcg_point_set do not need
      to be used as they should be same as the identifier_offset and the
      identifier for the spheres.

      In the case that spheres have different radius use this
      instead of the radius field.
