  Base class to describe discretized (micro)structural features of a material.
  
  One instance of this base class can be used to describe the current configuration
  the base class does not include time-dependent descriptions for the sake of
  clarity and because of the fact that virtually all simulations or experiments
  probe time by sampling. Therefore, time-dependent state descriptions should
  be realized with creating a set of :ref:`NXmicrostructure_snapshot_set` with instances of
  :ref:`NXmicrostructure_snapshot` using e.g. :ref:`NXmicrostructure_recon` base class instances.
