  A base class definition for a lock-in amplifier.
  
  The lock-in amplifier information: the device is being used to extract a (potentially)
  very weak input signal buried in the noisy background, where the input signal has
  the same frequency (or its harmonic) as a known reference signal, using heterodyn
  detection.
  This method extracts the amplitude and phase shift of the current signal to the reference.
  The reference signal might be created by a generator built-in into the lock-in amplifier.
