  A base class definition for a lock-in amplifier.
  
  The lock-in amplifier information: the device is being used to extract a (potentially)
  very weak input signal buried in the noisy background, where the input signal has
  the same frequency (or its harmonic) as carrier signal or reference signal, using heterodyne
  detection.
  
  This method extracts the amplitude and phase shift between input signal and reference signal.
  
  In single phase lock-in amplifiers used in high signal-to-noise ratio applications, only
  the amplitude is measured and phase difference is set to zero.
  
  In two phase lock-in amplifiers used in low signal-to-noise ratio applications, both the
  amplitude and phase difference are measured.
  
  Fields with partial names like low_passN, high_passN, etc., can be repeated for each channel
  of the lockin amplifier. It is envisioned that these fields are named low_pass_0, low_pass_1,
  and so on.
