  (NXshape):

    doc: |
      Describe the geometry (shape, dimension etc.) of the device.
      Specify the dimensions in 'SHAPE/size'. A sketch of the device should be
      provided in the 'sketch(NXdata)' field to clarify (i) the shape and
      dimensions of the device, and (ii) the input and outputs (i.e. the
      direction of the incoming and outcoming (split) beams).

    sketch(NXdata):
      doc: |
        Sketch of thedevice showing its geometry. The paths of the
        incoming and outgoing beam should be illustrated and labelled (0 for
        the incoming beam, and 1, 2,..., N_outputs for the outputs).
    size:
      doc: |
        Physical extent of the device. The device might be made up of one or
        more objects (NX_objects). The meaning and location of the axes used
        will vary according to the value of the 'shape' variable. 'N_shapepar'
        defines how many parameters:

        * For 'cube' the parameters are (width, length).
        * For 'cylinder' the parameters are (diameter, length).
        * For 'plate' the parameters are (width, height, length).
        * For 'prism' the parameters are (width, height, length).
        * For 'wedged' the parameters are (width, height, shortest length).
          The wedge angle should be provided in 'SHAPE/wedge_angle'.
        * For 'other' the parameters may be (A, B, C, ...) with the labels
          defined in the sketch plotted in 'SHAPE/sketch'.
