  Base class to store a pole figure (PF) computation.
  
  A pole figure is the X-ray diffraction intensity for specific integrated
  peaks for a hemispherical illumination of a real or virtual specimen.
symbols:
  n_y: |
    Number of pixel per pole figure in the slow direction.
  n_x: |
    Number of pixel per pole figure in the fast direction.
