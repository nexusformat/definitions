  Base class documenting the results obtained with a tool of the paraprobe-toolbox.
  
  The paraprobe-toolbox is a collection of open-source tools for performing
  efficient analyses of point cloud data where each point can represent atoms or
  (molecular) ions. A key application of the toolbox has been for research in the
  field of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and related Field Ion Microscopy (FIM):
  
  * `paraprobe-toolbox <https://www.gitlab.com/paraprobe/paraprobe-toolbox>`_
  * `M. Kühbach et al. <https://paraprobe-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/main/>`_
  
  The toolbox does not replace but complements existent software tools in this
  research field. Given its capabilities of handling points as objects with
  properties and enabling analyses of the spatial arrangement of and inter-
  sections between geometric primitives, the software can equally be used
  for analyzing data in Materials Science and Materials Engineering.
  
  The configuration and results of a run of a tool from the toolbox is documented
  using binary container formats. Currently, paraprobe-toolbox uses the
  Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5).
  
  The paraprobe coordinate system is the reference *NXcoordinate_system*
  for each geometric primitive.
# thereby implicitly all \@default attributes for geometric primitives point to the
# single instance ENTRY[entry]/COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET[coordinate_system_set]/paraprobe

  analysis_identifier(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Internal identifier used by the tool to refer to an analysis (aka simulation id).
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Possibility for leaving a free-text description about this analysis.
  config(NXserialized):
    doc: |
      The configuration file that was used to parameterize
      the algorithms that this tool has executed.
  window(NXcs_filter_boolean_mask):
    doc: |
      A bitmask which identifies all ions considered in the analysis.
    number_of_ions(NX_UINT):
      doc: |
        Number of ions covered by the mask.
        By default, the total number of ions in the dataset.
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
    bitdepth(NX_UINT):
      doc: |
        Number of bits assumed matching on a default datatype.
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
    mask(NX_UINT):
      doc: |
        The mask. The length of the mask is an integer multiple of bitdepth.
        In such case, padded bits are set to 0.

    # results_path(NX_CHAR):
    #   doc: |
    #     Path where the tool stores tool-specific results. If not specified,
    #    results will be stored in the current working directory.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis in this results file was started,
        i.e. when the respective executable/tool was started as a process.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
        information included when the analysis in this results file were
        completed and the respective process of the tool exited.
    status(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        A statement whether the tool executable managed to process the analysis
        or whether this failed. Status is written to the results file after the
        end_time beyond which point in time the tool must no longer compute
        any further analysis results but exit.
        
        Only when this status message is present and its value is `success`,
        one should consider the results of the tool. In all other cases it might
        b that the tool has terminated prematurely or another error occurred.
      enumeration: [success, failure]
  (NXuser):
  (NXcoordinate_system_set):
    doc: |
      Details about coordinate systems (reference frames) used. In atom probe several coordinate
      systems have to be distinguished. Names of instances of such :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
      should be documented explicitly and doing so by picking from the
      following controlled set of names:
      
      * paraprobe
      * lab
      * specimen
      * laser
      * instrument
      * detector
      * recon
      
      The aim of this convention is to support users with contextualizing which reference
      frame each instance (coordinate system) is. If needed, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations`
      are used to detail the explicit affine transformations whereby one can convert
      rpresentations between different reference frames.
      Inspect :ref:`NXtransformations` for further details.

    # workflow from the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling library
