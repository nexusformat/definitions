            List of the axes that are acquired simultaneously by the detector.
            These refer only to the experimental variables recorded by the electron analyser.
            Other variables such as temperature, manipulator angles etc. are labeled as fast or slow in the data.

            Axes may be less abstract than this, i.e. ['detector_x', 'detector_y'].
            If energy_scan_mode=sweep, fast_axes: ['energy', 'kx']; slow_axes: ['energy'] is allowed.

      Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used.
      The first transformation has to point either to another component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it relative to the experimental setup.
      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to the reference coordinate system."
