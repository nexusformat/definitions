  A base class that defines how the bias voltage sweep is performed in the
  scanning probe microscopy experiments.
type: group
NXbias_sweep(NXscan_control):
  scan_region(NXobject):
    doc: |
      The scan region is the area of phase space or sub-phase space where the scan is
      performed.
    scan_offset_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_VOLTAGE
      doc: |
        The starting voltage of the bias sweep. The range of voltages for the sweep can
        be defined with scan voltage offset and scan voltage range (difference between
        minimum and maximum voltage values in a sweep)
    scan_range_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_VOLTAGE
      doc: |
        The range of voltages for the sweep can be defined with scan voltage offset and
        scan voltage range (difference between minimum and maximum voltage values in a
        sweep)
    scan_start_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_VOLTAGE
      doc: |
        The start of the bias scan voltage.
    scan_end_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_VOLTAGE
      doc: |
        The end value of the bias scan voltage.
  linear_sweep(NXobject):
    doc: |
      In the linear sweep, the bias voltage is changed linearly from the start value
      to the end value.
    backward_sweep(NX_BOOLEAN):
      doc: |
        If the bias voltage sweep is also performed in the opposite direction.
    scan_points_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        The number of voltage points per sweep.
    step_size_bias(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_VOLTAGE
      doc: |
        The step size between the two consecutive bias voltage values during the sweep.
    reset_bias(NX_BOOLEAN):
      doc: |
        The reset_bias defines whether the bias voltage should be reset to the starting
        value after the sweep is completed.
    SCAN_data(NXdata):
      doc: |
        The scan data is the data collected during the scan.
        If the scan has several channels or derivatives from the channel data,
        please duplicate this NXdata group for each.
