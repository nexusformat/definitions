            The purpose of this field is to compute also composition-weighted
            products to yield a simple estimation which could potentially help
            scientists to judge if certain molecular ions are to be expected.
            The corresponding setting store_composition_weighted_product should be
            activated.

            The maximum number of isotopes of which the molecular ion
            should be composed. Currently this must not be larger than 32.
            
            Users should be warned that the larger the maximum_charge and
            especially the larger the maximum_number_of_isotopes is chosen,
            the eventually orders of magnitude more costly the search becomes.
            
            This is because paraprobe-ranger computes really all (at least)
            theoretically possible combinations that would have likely a
            mass-to-charge-state ratio in the specified mass_to_charge_interval.
            It is the challenge in atom probe to judge which of these (molecular)
            ions are feasible and also practically possible. This tool does not
            answer this question.
            
            Namely, which specific molecular ion will evaporate, remain stable
            during flight and becomes detected is a complicated and in many cases
            not yet in detail understood phenomenon. The ab-initio conditions
            before and during launch, the local environment, arrangement and field
            as well as the flight phase in an evacuated but not analysis chamber
            with a complex electrical field, eventual laser pulsing in place,
            temperature and remaining atoms or molecules all can have an effect
            which iontypes are really physically evaporating and detected.

            Report the accumulated atomic mass from each isotope building the ion.

            Relatistic effects are not accounted for.
        store_natural_abundance_product(NX_BOOLEAN):
          doc: |
            Report the product of the natural abundances from each isotope building
            the ion. Accounts for each identified ion.
            
            The value zero indicates it is not possible to build such molecular ion
            from nuclids which are all observationally stable.
            Very small values can give an idea/about how likely such a molecular ion
            is expected to form assuming equal probabilities.
            
            However in atom probe experiments this product has to be modified
            by the (spatially-correlated) local composition in the region from
            which the ions launch because the formation of a molecular ion depends
            as summarized under maximum_number_of_isotopes on the specific
            quantum-mechanical configuration and field state upon launch
            or/and (early state) of flight respectively.
            We are aware that this modified product can have a substantially
            different value than the natural_abundance_product.
            
            Natural abundancies folded with the estimated compositions of the
            specimen can differ by orders of magnitude.

        #     It should not be forgotten though the computation relies on assumptions:
