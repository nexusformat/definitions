NXapm_input_ranging:
  filename:
    doc: |
      Name of (NeXus)/HDF5 file which stores ranging definitions which define
      how mass-to-charge-state ratios map to iontypes and which iontypes are
      distinguished. The UNKNOWNTYPE iontype (unranged) is the default iontype.
      The ID of this special iontype is always reserved as 0. Each ion
      is assigned to the UNKNOWNTYPE by default. Iontypes are assigned
      by checking if the mass-to-charge-state ratio of an ion matches
      to any of the defined mass-to-charge-state ratio intervals.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256) hash
        which documents the binary state of the file to add an additional layer
        of reproducibility for tracking provenance.
  group_name_iontypes:
    doc: |
      Name of the group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions)
      inside the HDF5 file which refers to the ranging definition to use.
      A HDF5 file can store multiple ranging definitions. Using an ID is
      the mechanism to distinguish which specific ranging (version) will
      be processed. Reconstruction and ranging IDs can differ.
      They specify different IDs.
