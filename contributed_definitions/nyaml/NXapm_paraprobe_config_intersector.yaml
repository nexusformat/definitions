    intersection_detection_method:
      doc: |
        Specifies the method to use which decides if two objects intersect.
        For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of
        `M. Kühbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_, the tool by
        default assumes that two objects intersect if they share at least one
        ion with the same evaporation ID
        (shared_ion). Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections,
        the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to 
        tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks
        for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra to identify if two objects
        intersect or not.
        
        However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
        cases which the currently used library (TetGen) was not unable to
        tetrahedralize successfully. These cases were virtually always
        associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra
        which had portions of the mesh that were connected by almost point like
        tubes of triangles.
      enumeration: [shared_ion, tetrahedra_intersections]
    has_object_volume(NX_BOOLEAN):
      doc: |
        Specifies if the tool should load the volume of each object
        (if existent in the input file) to characterize the evolution of the
        objects' volume as a function of set identifier (e.g. time).
        
        This and the has_object_composition option enables to activate
        computations in the code which correlate the spatio-temporal tracking
        with an object's properties. This is useful to explore/understand how
        the object descriptor values evolve as a function of the parameterization
        of the object. To arrive at a detailed understanding and quantification
        of the differences of a given object as a function of delocalization and
        e.g. iso-surfacing settings.
        
        The point made in M. Kühbach et al. 2022, is that this functionality
        can be used to track for instance how the accumulated volume and
        composition of an object depends on its segmentation via iso-surfaces.
        The benefit of such computations is that users can inspect the
        parameter sensitivity of an objects representation rigorously.
    has_object_composition(NX_BOOLEAN):
      doc: |
        Specifies if the tool should load the composition of each object
        (if existent in the input file) to characterize the evolution of the
        object's composition as a function of set identifier. See the description
        of has_object_volume for further details. In M. Kühbach et al. 2022, both
        has_object options were used to characterize e.g. the parameter
        sensitivity of computed composition, volume, and shape specifically,
        for a carbide that was segmented via different carbon iso-composition
        values.

          Tracking is the process of building logical relations between objects
          based on proximity and mesh intersections. For each time step pairs
          of sets are compared: members of a current_set and a next_set.
          Members have to be objects and eventually can in addition be so-called
          proxies. Objects and proxies are non-degenerated closed polyhedra which
          are not necessarily convex. Proxies are doppelganger/replacement
          meshes of objects which would otherwise be impossible to describe
          with a closed mesh.

Iontypes are assigned by checking if the mass-to-charge-state ratio of an ion matches to any of the defined mass-to-charge-state ratio intervals.
    #     \@version:
    #       doc: Version identifier of the file such as a secure hash which documents the binary state of the file to add an additional layer of reproducibility from which file specifically contains these data.
    #   group_name_iontypes:
    #     doc: Name of the group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions) inside the HDF5 file which refers to the ranging definition to use. A HDF5 file can store multiple ranging definitions. Using an ID is the mechanism to distinguish which specific ranging (version) will be processed. Reconstruction and ranging ID can differ. They specify different IDs.
