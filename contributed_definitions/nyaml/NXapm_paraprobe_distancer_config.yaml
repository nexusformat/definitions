  Application definition for a configuration file of the paraprobe-distancer tool.
  
  The tool paraprobe-distancer tool evaluates exactly the shortest Euclidean distance for each
  member of a set of points against a set of triangles.
  
  Triangles can represent for instance the facets of a triangulated surface mesh like those returned by
  paraprobe-surfacer or any other set of triangles. Triangles do not have to be connected.
  
  Currently, paraprobe-distancer does not check if the respectively specified triangle sets are consistent,
  what their topology is, or whether or not these triangles are consistently oriented.
