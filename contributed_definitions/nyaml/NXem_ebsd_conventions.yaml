  Conventions for rotations and coordinate systems to interpret EBSD data.
  
  This is the main issue which currently is not in all cases documented
  and thus limits the interoperability and value of collected EBSD data.
  Not communicating EBSD data with such contextual pieces of information
  and the use of file formats which do not store this information is the
  key unsolved problem.

        The sample surface reference frame has coordinates Xs, Ys, Zs.
        In three dimensions these coordinates are not necessarily
        located on the surface of the sample as there are multiple

        In which direction are positive values for PCx measured from

        Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is
        embedded/laying inside the XdYd plane (of the detector
        reference frame).
        When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the
        detector x-axis direction, we state that we effectively
        normalize in fractions of the width of the detector.
        
        The issue with terms like width and height is that these
        degenerate if the detector region-of-interest is square-shaped.
        This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but
        state how we would measure distances practically with a ruler and
        how we then measure positive distances.
