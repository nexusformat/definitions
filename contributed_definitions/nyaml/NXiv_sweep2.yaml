  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements.
  
  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.
  
  This is the application definition describing temperature dependent IV curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.

          The temperature and voltage must be present as independently scanned controllers and
          the current sensor must also be present with its readings.

        This NXdata should contain separate fields for the current values at different temperature setpoints, for example current_at_100C.
        There should also be two more fields called temperature and voltage containing the setpoint values.
        There should also be a field with an array of rank equal to the number of different temperature setpoints and each child's dimension
        equal to the number of voltage setpoints.

When not selected, Bias remains at the last value of the sweep. This is useful e.g. when combining several sweep segments.

        Z-Controller>Setpoint 50E-12 # Set Point is the desired value of the control signal. It can be set by editing the number or using the slider bar. Click the "Set" button above the input field to use the actual value as Set Point. The slider shows the Set Point as well as the current value.
        Z-Controller>Setpoint unit A # Angstrom
        Z-Controller>P gain 6E-12 # The Type switches controller parameters between P/I (proportional gain/integral gain) and P/T (proportional gain/time constant). The formula for the controller in the frequency domain is: G(s) = P + I/s = P(1 + 1/(Ts)). The integral gain and time constant are related as follows: I = P/T.
        Z-Controller>I gain 39.8241E-9 # See "Z-Controller>P gain" below.
        Z-Controller>Time const (s) 150.662E-6 # See "Z-Controller>P gain" below.
        Z-Controller>TipLift (m) 0E+0 # Lifts the tip by the specified amount when then controller is switched off. This can be a positive or a negative number, i.e. the tip can also be moved towards the sample. Be careful with sign and value when using this feature.
        Z-Controller>Switch off delay (s) 0E+0 # Use this parameter for a reproducible position when switching off the Z-controller. When >0 and the Z-controller is switched off, it doesn't switch off immediately but continues to run for the specified time and averages the Z position.
