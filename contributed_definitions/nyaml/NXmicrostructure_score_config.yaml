          The code documents summary statistics like recrystallized volume fraction
          for each iteration. However, snapshots of the microstructure can take much
          space as SCORE is able to evolve automata with up to :math:`1600^3` cells.
          Snapshot data document the current microstructure which includes the grain
          assigned to each of these cells plus the state of the recrystallization front.
          
          Despite these front data make up for approximately one order of magnitude
          less cells than represented in the domain, more numerical data have to be
          collected each cell in the front than just a grain identifier.
