  Container for reporting a set of electron energy loss (EELS) spectra.
  
  Virtually the most important case is that spectra are collected in 
  a scanning microscope (SEM or STEM) for a collection of points.
  The majority of cases use simple d-dimensional regular scan pattern,
  such as single point, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
  
  The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
  For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
  binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
symbols:
# n_p: Number of scan points
  n_y: Number of pixel per EELS mapping in the slow direction.
  n_x: Number of pixel per EELS mapping in the fast direction.
  n_energy_loss: Number of electron energy loss bins.
NXspectrum_set_em_eels:
  (NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details how EELS spectra were processed from the detector readings.
    source:
      doc: |
        Typically the name of the input, (vendor) file from which all
        the NXdata instances in this NXspectrum_set_em_eels were loaded during
        parsing to represent them in e.g. databases.
      \@version:
        doc: |
          An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the dataset/file
          which represents the source digitally to support provenance tracking.
    program:
      doc: |
        Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
        to process detector data into the EELS spectra stack and summary.
      \@version:
        doc: |
          Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description
          of an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
          and build instructions can be found so that the program
          can be configured in such a manner that the result file
          is ideally recreatable yielding the same results.
