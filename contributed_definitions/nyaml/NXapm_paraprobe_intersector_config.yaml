        Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlations (v_v) is the process of building logical
        relations between objects, their proximity and eventual volumetric intersections.
        Here, objects are assumed to be represented as a set of triangulated surface meshes.
        
        Volumetric overlap and proximity of volumetric features is identified for members of
        sets of features to members of other sets of volumetric features. Specifically, for each time
        step :math:`k` pairs of sets are compared:
        Members of a so-called current_set to members of a so-called next_set.
        Members can be different types of volumetric features.
        
        Instances should use v_v_spatial_correlation as a name prefix.

      intersection_detection_method(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Specifies the method whereby to decide if two objects intersect volumetrically.
          For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of `M. Kühbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_,
          it is assumed by default that two objects intersect if they share at least one ion with the same evaporation ID (shared_ion).
          
          Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections, the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to
          tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra
          to identify if two objects intersect or not. However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
          cases which the tetrahedralization library used in the tests (TetGen) was not unable to tetrahedralize successfully.
          These cases were virtually always associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra which had portions
          of the mesh that were connected by almost point like tubes of triangles.
          
          Finding more robust methods for computing intersections between not necessarily convex polyhedra might improve
          the situation in the future. For practical reasons we have thus deactivated the functionality of tetrahedra-tetrahedron
          intersections in paraprobe-intersector.

            all volumetric_features. However, users might have formed
            a subset of this set where individuals were regrouped.
            For paraprobe-nanochem this is the case for objects and proxies.
            Specifically, objects are distinguished further into those far
            from and those close to the edge of the dataset.
            Similarly, proxies are distinguished further into those far
            from and those close to the edge of the dataset.
            So while these four sub-sets contain different so-called types of
            features, key is that they were all generated for one set, here the

#                          The total number of distinguished feature sets featureID.
#                          It is assumed that the members within all these featureID sets
#                          are representing a set together. As an example this set might represent
#                          all volumetric_features. However, users might have formed
#                          a subset of this set where individuals were regrouped.
#                          For paraprobe-nanochem this is the case for objects and proxies.
#                          Specifically, objects are distinguished further into those far
#                          from and those close to the edge of the dataset.
#                          Similarly, proxies are distinguished further into those far

#                          So while these four sub-sets contain different so-called types of
#                          features, key is that they were all generated for one set, here the
