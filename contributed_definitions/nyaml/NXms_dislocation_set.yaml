  Base class to describe details about dislocations observed in microstructures.
  
  Dislocations are one-dimensional crystal defects whose primary interest is
  that they are the carrier of plastic deformation. Conceptually dislocations
  are a continuum-scale description of how atoms arrange spatio-temporally on
  the one hand as a persistent defect which on the other hand though, when 
  inspected in detail for the atom dynamics and their interaction with other 
  crystal defects manifest as an involved microstructural feature for which 
  very different descriptions are used depending which length-, time-scale, 
  and research question people address.
  
  This is manifested in the large amount of literature on the topic:
  
  * https://www.sciencedirect.com/bookseries/dislocations-in-solids  
  
  Dislocations are one prominent group of representatives for one-dimensional
  features, other defects include disconnections and/or disclinations, and even
  more complicated configurations, especially when one considers not-necessarily
  crystalline materials, quasi crystals. It would be rude to claim that a single
  base class can encompass the entire complexity that this effectively 
  coarse-graining of atomic spatio-temporal configurations has, in an effort 
  to simplicify the description in the hope to arrive at physical models which
  do not need to take into account the location and movement of every atom.
  
  However, it is also a fact that not every description, research question, and 
  thus use cases that one could think of what one should store as data and metadata
  for one-dimensional, primarily line-type crystal defects, is equally relevant
  for an ensemble of research studies.
  
  Thus, for the design of concrete schemata for the purpose of structured storage
  of research data on dislocations or studies where dislocations are measured
  or characterized, one has to prioritize which descriptors and aspects about
  dislocations are likely relevant for a large number of users of a research 
  infrastructure. Consequently, it is possible to narrow down the scope of 
  the base class and application definition.
  
  It is noteworthy to mention that this applies not only to description
  using NeXus, but points to the problem of creating a golden-bullet schema
  capable of handling all possible subtleties.
  
  For now we have to accept that is not yet an ontology of e.g. the above
  understanding of what dislocations are. Pragmatically we thus make the
  following assumptions:
  
  * This base class is essentially a template how specific often referred  
    quantities for one-dimensional crystal defects can be stored.  
  * In practice dislocations have a finite length as they are embedded in a  
    finite specimen and wired into an ensemble of adjoining dislocations  
    or other adjoining crystal defects.  
  * There are the following general approaches of studying/characterizing  
  * 1. Indirect measurements where dislocations characterized statistically.  
    In this case different types of dislocations are distinguished  
    (geometrically-necessary, mobile, immobile), mainly motivated by  
    different constitutive, continuum-models how they are threated in  
    computer simulations with respect to what their effect is on ms evolution.  
  * 2. Electron microscopy measurements of single or several dislocation (bundles)  
    In this case post-processing strategies are necessary which can  
    extract statistical descriptors or d-dimensional reconstructions  
  * 3. Atomic-scale-resolved simulations. In this case the most frequently  
    performed tasks are again post-processing into polyline networks,  
    detailed local investigations of the atomic configurations, or both  
    with or without some correlation.  
  * 4. Analytical approaches whereby dislocations are resolved at the continuum  
    scale, as line defects containing other elementary defects (for instance)  
    in models of disconnection motion), or again atomically resolved treatments.  
  
  From this we can conclude that an NXms_dislocation_set can primarily be
  useful as a wrapper class in which specific details about dislocations
  can be stored in an arbitrarily nested manner.

# and this results in either a description at the continuum-scale or based on the atomic architecture and dynamics
# often thermodynamics are used to describe ensemble statistics about these defects along the dislocation line
# or of the dislocation network, a distinction, which is especially in the research on recovery phenomena, oftentimes not well separated.
