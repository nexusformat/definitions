          All the setting values of the independently scanned controllers are listed under corresponding
          NXsensor groups. Similarly, seperate NXsensor groups are used to store the readings from each
          measurement sensor.
          
          For example, in a temperature-dependent IV measurement, the temperature and voltage must be 
          present as independently scanned controllers and the current sensor must also be present with
          its readings.

              For each point in the scan space, either the nominal setpoint of an independently scanned controller
              or a representative average value of a measurement sensor is registered.

              The length of each sensor's data value array stored in this group should be equal to the number of scan points
              probed in this scan. For every scan point [N], the corresponding sensor value can be picked from index [N].
              This allows the scan to be made in any order as the user describes above in the experiment. We get matching
              values simply using the index of the scan point.

              the nominal setpoint or average reading values listed above in the value field.
