      Visualization of the ODF intensity as orthogonal sections through Euler space.
      
      This is one example of typical default plots used in the texture
      community in Materials Engineering.
      
      Mind that the Euler space is a distorted space. Therefore, equivalent
      orientations show intensity contributions in eventually multiple
      locations.
