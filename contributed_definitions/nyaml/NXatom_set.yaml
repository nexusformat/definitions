NXatom_set(NXobject):
  identifier(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A unique identifier whereby such an ion can be referred to
      via the service offered as described in identifier_type.

      How can the identifier be resolved?
    enumeration: [inchi]

      The identifier zero is reserved for the special unknown ion type.

  nuclide_hash(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Vector of nuclide hash values.
      
      Individual hash values :math:`H` is :math:`H = Z + N \cdot 256` with :math:`Z`
      encode the number of protons :math:`Z` and the number of neutrons :math:`N`
      of each nuclide respectively. :math:`Z` and :math:`N` have to be 8-bit unsigned integers.
      
      The array is sorted in decreasing order. For the rationale behind this see `M. Kühbach et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (n_ivec_max,)
  nuclide_list(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Table which decodes the entries in nuclide_hash into a human-readable matrix of instances.
      The first column specifies the nuclide mass number, i.e. using the hashvalues
      from the isotope_vector this is :math:`Z + N` or 0. The value 0 documents that no
      isotope-specific information about the element encoded is relevant.
      The second row specifies the number of protons :math:`Z` or 0.
      The value 0 in this case documents a placeholder or that no element-specific
      information is relevant.
      Taking a carbon-14 nuclide as an example the mass number is 14.
      That is encoded as a value pair (14, 6) as one row of the table.
      
      Therefore, this notation is the typical superscribed nuclide mass number
      and subscripted number of protons element notation e.g. :math:`^{14}C`.
      The array is stored matching the order of nuclide_hash.

  # color(NX_CHAR):
  #   doc: |
  #     Color code used for visualizing such ions.
  volume(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Assumed volume of the ion.
      
      In atom probe microscopy this field can be used to store the reconstructed
      volume per ion (average) which is typically stored alongside ranging
      definitions.
    unit: NX_VOLUME
  charge(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Charge of the ion.
    unit: NX_CHARGE
  charge_state(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Signed charge state if the atoms form an ion reported in multiples of electron charge.
      
      In the example of atom probe microscopy, only positive values will be measured
      as the ions are accelerated by a negatively signed bias electric field.
      In the case that the charge state is not explicitly recoverable, the value should
      be set to zero.
      
      In atom probe microscopy this is for example the case when using
      classical ranging definition files in formats like RNG, RRNG.
      These file formats do not document the charge state explicitly
      but the number of atoms of each element per molecular ion
      surplus the mass-to-charge-state-ratio interval.
      Details on ranging definition files can be found in the literature:

    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable name (e.g. Al +++) of the atom set, the atom group, or ion type.
      The string should consists of UTF-8 characters, ideally using LaTeX
      notation to specify the isotopes, ions, and charge state.
      Examples are 12C + or Al +++.
      
      To ease automated parsing, isotope_vector should be the
      preferred machine-readable information used.
  mass_to_charge_range(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Associated lower (mqmin) and upper (mqmax) bounds of the
      mass-to-charge-state ratio interval(s) [mqmin, mqmax]
      (boundaries inclusive). This field is primarily of interest
      for documenting :ref:`NXprocess` steps of indexing a
      ToF/mass-to-charge state histogram.
