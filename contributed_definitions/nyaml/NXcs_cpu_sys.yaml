      Granularizing at the socket level.
      
      Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single CPU one
      could describe using one instance of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_obj` inside one instance of
      :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
      A dual-socket server one could describe using two instances of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_obj`
      inside one instance of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
      A server with two dual-socket server nodes one could describe
      with the above group of one :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys` into another :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
