  Details about a component as it is defined by its manufacturer.
type: group
NXfabrication(NXobject):
  vendor(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Company name of the manufacturer.
  model(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Version or model of the component named by the manufacturer.
    \@version:
      type: NX_CHAR

        If different versions exist are possible, the value in this field should be made
        specific enough to resolve the version.
  identifier(NXidentifier):
    doc: |
      Ideally, (globally) unique persistent identifier. This may contain e.g.
      a serial number or hash identifier of the component.
  construction_year(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      Datetime of components initial construction. This refers to the date of
      first measurement after new construction or to the relocation date,
      if it describes a multicomponent/custom-build setup.
      Should be a ISO8601 date/time stamp. It is recommended to add an explicit time zone,
      otherwise the local time zone is assumed per ISO8601.
  capability(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Free-text list with eventually multiple terms of
      functionalities which the component offers.
