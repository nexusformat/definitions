  A base class describing piezo actuator settings for scanning probe microscopy.
  
  Piezoelectric actuators work utilizing the inverse-piezoelectric effect, when a voltage
  is applied on the material and it deforms proportional to the applied voltage.
  Description below shows calibration coefficients and other configuration parameters of open loop piezo actuators (that is actuators without capacitive sensor feedback systems).

# Discussion: No need to create this base class rather we can define in spm application definition.

NXpiezo_config_spm(NXobject):
  piezo_material(NXpiezoelectric_material):
    doc: |
      The material description and properties of the piezoelectric scanner materials.
    curvature_radius_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_LENGTH
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X or Y. There are 2 parameters in X and Y directions. It can be set
        approximately to the length of the piezo tube along X and Y axis.
  calibration(NXcalibration):
    calibration_type(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        The name of the calibration type, sometimes it is called
        `active calibration`.
      enumeration: [active, passive]
    calibration_name:
      doc: |
        A specific name of the calibration (e.g. active type with name 'LHe').
    calibration_date(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        The date of the calibration.
    calibrated_AXIS(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        The AXIS (substring) denotes X, Y or Z. There are three directions X, Y, and Z for calibration,
        along with three available parameters each: Calibration (m/V), Range (m), and HV gain. Only
        two of these parameters are required to define the calibration. Consequently, when any
        value is changed, one of the other values will be automatically updated.
    hv_gain_N(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X or Y or Z. In some systems, there is an HV gain readout feature. For
        these systems, the HV gain should be automatically adjusted whenever the gain is
        changed at the high voltage amplifier.
    range_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_LENGTH
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X or Y or Z. There are 3 parameters in X, Y and Z directions. The range
        is the maximum distance the piezo can move.
    calibration_coefficient_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The calibration coefficient is the ratio of the actual distance moved by the piezo due to
        the voltage applied to the piezo. It is also called first-order correction.
    tilt_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANGLE
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X and Y directions, and for both directions tilt needs to be adjusted according
        to the actual surface.
    2nd_order_correction_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X and Y directions. If you know them, you can enter the 2nd order piezo
        characteristics to compensate the error for that axis.
        The following equation shows the
        interpretation of the 2nd order correction parameters, For the X-piezo: "Ux = 1/cx · X + cxx · X2"
        with units: "[V] = [V/m] · [m] + [V/m2] · [m2]"
        where cx is the calibration of the piezo X and cxx is the 2nd order correction. The unit for
        such the second-order correction is (V/m^2).
    drift_N(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        The N (substring) denotes X, Y and Z directions. Define the
        drift speed [m/s] for all three axes. When the compensation is on, the piezo will start to
        move at that speed.
