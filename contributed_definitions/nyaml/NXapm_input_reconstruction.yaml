  Metadata of a dataset (tomographic reconstruction) in atom probe microscopy.

NXapm_input_reconstruction:
  filename:
    doc: |
      Name of the (NeXus)/HDF5 file which stores reconstructed ion position
      and mass-to-charge-state ratios. Such an HDF5 file can store multiple
      reconstructions. Using an identifier (ID) is the mechanism which
      paraprobe uses to distinguish which specific reconstruction will
      be processed. With this design it is possible that the same HDF5
      file stores multiple versions of a reconstruction of e.g. the same
      or different measured datasets, respectively.
    \@version:
      doc: |
        Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256) hash
        which documents the binary state of the file to add an additional layer
        of reproducibility for tracking provenance.
  dataset_name_reconstruction:
    doc: |
      Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
      specific reconstructed ion positions to use for this analysis.
  dataset_name_mass_to_charge:
    doc: |
      Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
      specific mass-to-charge-state ratios to use for this analysis.
