  Computational geometry description of a set of points in Euclidean space.
  
  The relevant coordinate system should be referred to in the NXtransformations
  instance. Points may have an associated time value; however users are advised
  to store time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where
  for each point in time there is an NXcg_point_set instance which specifies the
  points locations. This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer
  simulations, where positions of points are taken at the same point in time;
  and therefore an additional time array would demand to store redundant pieces
  of information for each point.

      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
      identifiers for points. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
      or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
      interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
      For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
      
      The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
      identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
      or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
