  Base class for reporting a set of images.
  
  The most commonly used scanning methods are supported. That is one-,
  two-, three-dimensional ROIs discretized using regular Euclidean tilings.
  
  Colloquially, an image is understood as a discretized representation of intensity distribution
  detected or simulated for some ROI. When discretized with regular Euclidean tilings, the terms
  pixel and voxel identify the smallest discretization unit. In this case, pixel and voxel are polygonal
  or polyhedral unit cells respectively of the underlying tiling of the ROI within the reference space.
  For all other tilings e.g. non-equispaced, the shape and size of pixel and voxel differs. Using the term
  (image) point is eventually more appropriate when working with such tilings.
  
  Therefore, all docstrings in this base class refer to points (including pixel and voxel i.e. regular tilings).
  
  Point coordinates identify the location of the barycenter.
  
  For images in reciprocal space in practice, complex numbers are encoded via some formatted pair of real values.
  Typically, fast algorithms for computing Fourier transformations (FFT) are used to encode
  images in reciprocal (frequency) space. FFT libraries are used for implementing the key functionalities of
  these mathematical operations.
  
  Different libraries use different representations and encoding of the images.
  Details can be found in the respective sections of the typical FFT libraries documentations

  Users are strongly advised to inspect carefully which specific conventions their library uses
  to enable storing and modifying the implementation of their code such that the serialized
  representations as they are detailed here for NeXus match.
  
  It is often the case that several images are combined using processing. In this case,
  the number of images which are combined into collections is not necessarily the same
  for each collection. The NXimage base class addresses this logical distinction
  through the notation of identifier_image and identifier_group concepts.
  That is identifier_image are always counting from offset in increments of one.
  as each image is its own entity. By contrast, a group may contain no, or several images.
  Consequently, identifier_group are not required to be contiguous.

#         Users are strongly advised to inspect carefully which specific conventions their library uses
#         to enable storing and modifying the implementation of their code such that the serialized
#         representations as they are detailed here for NeXus match.
#         
#         It is often the case that several images are combined using processing. In this case,
#         the number of images which are combined into collections is not necessarily the same
#         for each collection. The NXimage base class addresses this logical distinction
#         through the notation of identifier_image and identifier_group concepts.
#         That is identifier_image are always counting from offset in increments of one.
#         as each image is its own entity. By contrast, a group may contain no, or several images.
#         Consequently, identifier_group are not required to be contiguous.
