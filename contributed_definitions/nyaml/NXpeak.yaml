  Description of peaks, their functional form or measured support.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_support: Number of support points
NXpeak:
  label:
    doc: |
      Human-readable identifier to specify which concept/entity
      the peak represents/identifies.
  peak_model:
    doc: |
      Is the peak described analytically via a functional form
      or is it empirically defined via measured/reported
      intensity/counts as a function of an independent variable.
      
      If the functional form is not empirical or gaussian, users
      should enter other for the peak_model and add relevant details
      in the NXcollection.
    enumeration: [empirical, gaussian, lorentzian, other]
  position(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
      this array holds the position values for the independent variable.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, n_support]]
  intensity(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
      this array holds the intensity/count values at each position.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, n_support]]
  (NXcollection):
    doc: |
      In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this
      collection holds parameter of (and eventually) the functional form.
      For example in the case of Gaussians mu, sigma, cut-off values, 
      and background intensity are relevant parameter.
