category: base
doc: |
  Base class for describing a peak, its functional form, and support values
  (i.e., the discretization (points) at which the function has been evaluated).
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  dimRank: |
    Rank of the dependent and independent data arrays (for
    multidimensional/multivariate fit.)
type: group
NXpeak(NXobject):
  label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable label which specifies which concept/entity
      the peak represents/identifies.
  data(NXdata):
    position(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Position values along one or more data dimensions (to hold the
        values for the independent variable).
      dimensions:
        rank: dimRank
        doc: |
          The ``position`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)
          as the ``intensity`` field. Each individual dimension of ``position``
          must have the same number of points as the corresponding dimension in
          the ``intensity`` field.
    intensity(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        This array holds the intensity/count values of the fitted peak at each position.
      dimensions:
        rank: dimRank
        doc: |
          The ``intensity`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)
          as the ``intensity`` field. Each individual dimension of ``position``
          must have the same number of points as the corresponding dimension in
          the ``position`` field.
  function(NXfit_function):
    doc: |
      The functional form of the peak. This could be a Gaussian, Lorentzian,
      Voigt, etc.
  total_area(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Total area under the curve.

      Declares which child group contains a path leading
      to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
