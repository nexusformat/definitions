  Base class to document an algorithm for recovering charge state and nuclide composition of a (molecular) ion.
  
  Currently ranging definitions in the research field of atom probe face have limitations:
  
  1. A ranging definition maps all signal within a mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval
     on one iontype. Facing limited mass-resolving-power, there are mass-to-charge-state-ratio
     values, though, for which not only multiple (molecular) ions are indistinguishable but
     also for which the current practice of documenting classical ranging definitions is incomplete.
  2. Indeed, ranging definitions often report only (for each interval) the
     mass-to-charge-state-ratio intervals surplus the composition of elements
     that build the (molecular) ion.
  3. Therefore, classical ranging definitions demand a post-processing with an algorithm
     which can identify nuclides from which the (molecular) ion is constructed
     and a charge state possibly recovered. Combinatorial algorithms are used for this purpose.
  
  This base class documents the configuration and results of such an algorithm.
symbols:

NXapm_charge_state_analysis(NXprocess):
  # Details and results of the combinatorial analyses of a ranging definition
  # to clarify (if possible) the charge_state of an ion and its (not necessarily)
  # unique combination of nuclides contained including their multiplicity.
  # input/config
  nuclides(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Input constraint, list of nuclide_hash for typically elements used for the
      ranging definition of the ion whose charge state the analyses covered.
      The list contains each hash as many times as its multiplicity.
      Nuclides are encoded using the hashing rule that is defined in :ref:`NXion`.
      
      As an example, a ranging definition H:2 O:1 is configured by setting nuclides to
      a list with entries :math:`1 + 256 * 0`, :math:`1 + 256 * 0`, :math:`8 + 256 * 0`.
      An empty list does not release the constraint. Instead, a list with all elements
      in the periodic table (encoded as nuclide_hash values) should be used, i.e.
      :math:`1 + 256 * 0`, :math:`2 + 256 * 0`, and so on and so forth.
      
      Keep in mind that with a weakly constrained parameter space the combinatorial
      analysis may become very time consuming!

      If the value is false, it means that non-unique solutions are accepted.
      These are solutions where multiple candidates have been built from
      different nuclide instances but the charge_state of all the ions is the same.
