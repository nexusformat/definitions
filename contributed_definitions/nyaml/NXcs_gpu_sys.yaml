      Granularizing at the socket level.
      
      Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single GPU one
      could describe using one instance of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj` inside one instance of
      :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys`.
      A desktop computer with two GPUs one could describe using two instances
      of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj` inside one instance of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys`.
      A GPU server like nowadays used for artificial intelligence
      one could describe as a system with n instances of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj`
      in one :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys` or :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
