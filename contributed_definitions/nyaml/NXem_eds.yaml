  Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDXS).
  
  `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation <https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308>`_ should be used.
  
  X-ray spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive technique. Therefore, three-dimensional elemental
  characterzation requires typically a sequence of characterization and preparation of the
  surface to expose a new surface layer that can be characterized in the next acquisition.
  In effect, the resulting three-dimensional elemental information mappings are truely the
  result of a correlation and post-processing of several measurements which is the field
  of correlative tomographic usage of electron microscopy.

        This field can be used when creating instances of NXpeak is not desired.
        However, a collection of instances of NXpeak with individual NXion specified
        enables also to distinguish isotopic information.

        Individual element-specific EDS/EDX/EDXS/SXES mapping
        
        A composition map is an image whose intensities for each pixel are the
        accumulated X-ray quanta *under the curve(s)* of a set of peaks.
        
        These element-specific EDS maps are NXimage_r_set instances
        and need to be named with the name of the element from the 
        element_names field.
        
        We often observe that signal contributions from several peaks
        are summarized and shown together, e.g. the combined signal
        under the curve of carbon and oxygen.
        
        In this case specify the processing details using peaks and weights.
