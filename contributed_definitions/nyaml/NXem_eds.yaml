  Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX).
  
  `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation <https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308>`_ should be used.

# NEW ISSUE: use computational geometry to offer arbitrary scan pattern
# NEW ISSUE: make the binning flexible per scan point

  indexing(NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details about computational steps how peaks were indexed as elements.
    (NXprogram):
      doc: |
        The program with which the indexing was performed.
    PEAK(NXpeak):
      doc: |
        Name and location of each X-ray line which was indexed as a known ion.
        For each ion, an NXion instance should be created which specifies
        the origin of the signal. For each ion also the relevant IUPAC notation
        X-ray lines should be specified.
      (NXion):
        energy_range(NX_NUMBER):
          doc: |
            Associated lower :math:`[e_{min}, e_{max}]` bounds of the
            energy which is assumed associated with this peak.

        energy(NX_NUMBER):
          doc: |
            Theoretical energy of the line according to IUPAC.
          unit: NX_ENERGY
        iupac_line_names(NX_CHAR):
          doc: |
            IUPAC notation identifier of the line which the peak represents.
            
            This can be a list of IUPAC notations for (the seldom) case that
            multiple lines are grouped with the same peak.

      doc: |
        List of the names of identified elements.

      doc: |
        Individual element-specific EDS/EDX/EDXS/SXES mapping
        
        A composition map is an image whose intensities for each pixel are the
        accumulated X-ray quanta *under the curve(s)* of a set of peaks.
        
        These element-specific EDS maps are NXimage_r_set instances
        and need to be named with the name of the element from the 
        element_names field.
      (NXprocess):
        peaks(NX_CHAR):
          doc: |
            A list of NXpeak instance names whose X-ray quanta
            where accumulated for each pixel which yields an element-specific
            EDS map.
