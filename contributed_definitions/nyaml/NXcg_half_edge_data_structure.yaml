  Computational geeometry description of a half-edge data structure.
  
  Such a data structure can be used to efficiently circulate around faces
  and iterate over vertices of a planar graph.
# holes in the polygon mesh can be handled
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  n_v: |
    The number of vertices.
  n_f: |
    The number of faces.
  n_he: |
    The number of half-edges.

      Users are referred to the literature for the background of L. Weinberg's
      work about topological characterization of planar graphs:
      
      * `L. Weinberg 1966a, <https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1964.1082216>`_
      * `L. Weinberg, 1966b, <https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/0114062>`_
      * `E. A. Lazar et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.095505>`_
      
      and how this work can e.g. be applied in space-filling tessellations
      of microstructural objects like crystals/grains.
  
  # eventually store the Weinberg vector as an integer array
  # which could be more efficient
  # see https://jerryyin.info/geometry-processing-algorithms/half-edge/
  # for an illustrative example of half-edge data structures
