      low-pass:
        doc: |
          A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals
          with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency and
          attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.
      high-pass:
        doc: |
          A high-pass filter is a filter that passes signals
          with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and
          attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.
      band-pass:
        doc: |
          A band-pass filter is a filter that passes signals
          within a certain frequency range and attenuates signals outside that range.
      band-stop:
        doc: |
          A band-stop filter is a filter (opposite to the band-pass) that attenuates signals
          within a certain frequency range and passes signals outside that range.
      broadband:
        doc: |
          A broadband filter is a filter that passes signals
          over a wide range of frequencies with minimal attenuation.

    doc: |
      The number of preamplifier channels are assigned.
  active_channels(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The number of preamplifier channels are ready to be used. (array for active
      channels)

      The output signal does not go through a feedback loop to adjust the
      amplification of the amplifier. (array for active channels)

  # doc: !!! The ratio of the amplitude of the output signal to the amplitude of the input signal. (array for active channels) # From google.

    doc: |
      The ratio of the amplitude of the target signal to the amplitude of the noise in
      the output signal of the amplifier. S/N=V_signal/V_noise. (array for active
      channels)
  crosstalk_factor(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: db
    doc: |
      The unwanted coupling between different channels (if active >1).
      In ideal amplifier, channels are independent of each other, But due to different resources
      sharing (e.g., same power supply, electromagnetic interference), there may have some
      unwanted coupling between different channels, which is called crosstalk.

    doc: |
      If measures are taken for reducing interferences between different signalling
      pathways.
  bandwidth(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    doc: |
      The spectrum of frequency it can amplify, from its lowest to highest frequency
      limits. If it is difference of the frequencies, please also provide :ref:
      `center_frequency </NXamplifier/center_frequency-field>`.
  center_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    doc: |
      The frequency in the middle of the bandwidth.
  lower_cutoff_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    doc: |

      -3dB point).
  upper_cutoff_frequency(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    doc: |
      The upper frequency point of the bandwidth where gain drops significantly (e.g.,
      -3dB point).
