  Computational geometry description of a geodesic mesh.
  
  People from geodesic/surveyors will likely have specific demands and
  different views about what should be included in such a base class, given
  that nested geodesic meshes are a key component of climate modelling tools.
  For now we propose to use this base class as a container to organize metadata
  and data related to geodesic meshes.
  
  Specifically an instance of this base class should detail the rule set how
  how the geodesic (surface) mesh was instantiated as there are many
  possibilities. A geodesic surface mesh is in this sense a triangulated
  surface mesh with metadata. For additional details as an introduction
  into the topic see e.g.:

  Here, especially the section on subdivision schemes is relevant.
