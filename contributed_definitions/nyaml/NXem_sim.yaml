  Base class for simulating electron microscopy relevant beam-matter interaction.
  
  The concept behind this base class is to keep it as generic as possible
  that simulations of electron/ion beam interaction with matter can be
  represented. This base class is envisioned as the twin of the :ref:`NXem_msr`
  base class.
  
  It is an attempt to test the idea if at some point one might even use the
  same base class template to describe measurements and computer simulations
  of electron microscopy. This idea is attractive because the only practical
  difference between a description of a measurement with a microscope and a
  computer simulation is that the latter is typically a substantially simplified
  representation of the real microscope surplus the focus of the research
  in such cases on specific questions.
  
  Such simplification can be with respect to the optical setup, typically the
  ignoring of the fact that the electron beam is produced by a complex setup
  of lenses while in simulations often single Einzel lenses are considered.
  Dynamics of the environment like temperature fluctuation in a lab, vibrations,
  users, and multiple detectors are typically either ignored or reduced in
  complexity and number and coming with idealizations to keep the simulations
  focused on the specific reason questions and efficiently numerically executable.
