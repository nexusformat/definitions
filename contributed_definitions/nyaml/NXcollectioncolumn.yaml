      Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used.
      The first transformation has to point either to another component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it relative to the experimental setup.
      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to the reference coordinate system."
