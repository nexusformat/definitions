    #       you hunt for PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.<JOBID>.h5
    #       if the references to dataset files there end with nxs you know
    #       data are in an NXapm so reconstruction will be in

    #       ranging will be in
    #       entry/atom_probe/ranging/peak_identification
    #       however if the references to dataset files there end with != nxs
    #       you point the tool to in fact data inside PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results
    #       because in this case transcoding was necessary but also then you
    #       will find the data in entry/atom_probe/.. respectively

        On a mid term perspective we would like to evolve the paraprobe-toolbox
        to an implementation stage where it works exclusively with completely
        provenance-tracked formats for both the configuration of the workflow step
        and/or analysis with each tool and also for the output of these analyses
        in the form of so-called tool-specific results files.
        Currently the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) is used to store such data.
        
        Different file formats can be used to inject reconstructed datasets and
        ranging definitions into the toolbox. Traditionally, these are the POS, 
        ePOS, and APT files with the tomographic reconstruction and other metadata
        and RNG and RRNG file formats for the ranging definitions how mass-to-charge
        state-ratio values map on (molecular) ion types. Such input should be
        injected via specific NeXus/HDF5 files which are documented
        in compliance with the NXapm application definition.
        
        So far the paraprobe-toolbox was used as a standalone tool. Therefore, it
        was not relevant during the development to focus on interoperability.
        Essentially paraprobe-transcoder was used as a parser to transcode data
        in the above-mentioned file formats into a paraprobe-specific
        representation. This transcoding should become deprecated.
        Here we describe steps we have taken into this direction.
        
        With the work in the FAIRmat project and the desire to make the paraprobe-
        toolbox also accessible as a cloud-computing capable service in the Nomad
        Remote Tools Hub (NORTH) the topic of interoperability became more important
        and eventually the NXapm application definition was proposed.
        NORTH is a GUI and related service in a NOMAD OASIS instance which allows
        to spawn preconfigured docker containers via JupyterHub.
        Currently, NORTH includes the so-called apm container. A container with
        tools specific for analyzing data from atom probe microscopy as well as
        processing of point cloud and mesh data.
        
        The NXapm application definition and related implementation work within
        NOMAD OASIS enabled users to parse content of POS, ePOS, APT, RNG, and
        RRNG files, surplus key metadata from vendor-agnostic electronic lab notebook
        solutions directly into NOMAD OASIS via the uploads section.
        The process is automated and yields an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5 file
        inside the uploads section in return.
        
        With these improvements made there is no longer a need for - at least the
        users of a NOMAD OASIS and NORTH instance to use the deprecated 
        PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.*.h5 files. Ideally, paraprobe should
        automatically detect that the input can now be an NXapm-compliant NeXus/HDF5
        file and in response work with this file directly.
        To remain compliant with users however who do not have or do not wish
        to use a NOMAD OASIS or NXapm or NeXus at all right now, the solution is
        as follows:
        
        Calling the configuration stage of paraprobe-transcoder is always mandatory.
        It is always the first step of working with the toolbox. In this process
        the user defines the input files. These can either be nxs i.e. the NXapm/NeXus/
        HDF5 file from e.g. the upload section, or such a file that was obtained from
        a colleague with a NOMAD OASIS instance.
        In all other cases, users can pass the reconstruction and ranging definitions
        using the traditional POS, ePOS, or APT and RNG or RRNG file formats respectively.
        
        Based on which input the user delivers, the parmsetup-transcoder tool then
        creates a configuration file PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs and
        informs the user whether the input was NeXus (and thus if all relevant
        input is already available) or whether the paraprobe-transcoder tool needs
        to be executed to convert the content of the vendor files first into a
        format which paraprobe can provenance track and understand.
        In the latter case, the PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file is
        used to communicate to all subsequently used tools from which files
        the tools can expect to find the reconstruction and ranging definitions.
        
        All subsequent analysis steps start also with a tool-specific configuration.
        This configuration step reads in (among others) the
        PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Config.SimID.*.nxs file from which the configuration
        tool identifies automatically whether to read the reconstruction and ranging data
        from PARAPROBE.Transcoder.Results.SimID.*.h5 or directly the NXapm-compliant
        NeXus/HDF5 file that was created upon preparing the upload or the file shared
        from a colleague. This design removes the need for unnecessary copies of the data.
        Currently still though users should execute the transcoder step as it will
        generate a supplementary XDMF topology field with which the data in either
        the NeXus/HDF5 or the transcoded vendor files can be displayed using e.g.
        Paraview. For this purpose XDMF is used.
        
        Of course ideally the APT community would at some point converge to use
        a common data exchange file format. To this end, AMETEK/Cameca's APT file format
        could be a good starting point but so far it is lacking a consistent way of
        how to store generalized ranging definitions and post-processing results.
        POS, ePOS, Rouen's ATO, as well as other so far used representations of data
        like CSV or text files have, to the best of our current knowledge, no
        concept of how to marry reconstruction and (optional) ranging data into
        one self-descriptive format.
        
        This summarizes the rationale behind the current choices of the I/O for
        paraprobe. Furthermore, this summarizes also why the fundamental design
        of splitting an analysis always into steps of configuration (with parmsetup),
        task execution (with the respective C/C++ or Python tool of the toolbox),
        and post-processing (e.g. with autoreporter) is useful because it offers
        a clear description of provenance tracking. This is a necessary step to make
        atom probe microscopy data at all better aligned with the aims of the
        FAIR principles.
        
        The internal organization of the data entries in the atom_probe group
        in this application definition for paraprobe-transcoder results files
        mirror the definitions of the NXapm for consistency reasons.
    #     APSuite, RRNG, RNG, and NeXus/HDF5 NXapm in such a way that they can
    #     be used with the tools of the paraprobe-toolbox.
