  A base class for bias spectroscopy to describe the change in the physical properties
  of the sample with respect to the sweep voltage applied on a sample of STM/AFM/... experiment.
  
  In these experiments an electric potential is applied between the (conductive) sample and the probe
  (tip), and the physical properties (e.g. tunnelling current) is measured as the function of this
  potential. The potential is varied in so-called voltage sweeps and the corresponding properties are
  recorded accordingly.

      The measurement of the I(V) curve can come in two ways:
      1. Constant spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end with a constant
      spacing between the tip and surface.
      2. Variable spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end in a discretized
      spacing between the tip and surface. (Either an array of voltages, or the steps are defined).

      The PID (proportional, integral, differential feedback system) positioner information while running
      bias voltage-tunneling current measurement.
      
      These components position the probe relative to the sample, thus help obtaining maps of the data
      across the sample surface.

      unit: NX_LENGTH
      doc: |
        The z-offset is a starting tip position before the sweep starts (typically the position of a
        piezo element).

      # each other (e.g. spiral)
      doc: |

        coordinate or mapping the response at constant voltage, etc.
