  results storage of the composition space tool and make these data at the
  same time directly understandable for research data management systems
  like NOMAD Oasis.

        Details about coordinate systems (reference frames) used. In atom probe several coordinate
        systems have to be distinguished. Names of instances of such :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
        should be documented explicitly and doing so by picking from the
        following controlled set of names:
        
        * composition_space
        * lab
        * specimen
        * laser
        * instrument
        * detector
        * recon
        
        The aim of this convention is to support users with contextualizing which reference
        frame each instance (coordinate system) is. If needed, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations`
        are used to detail the explicit affine transformations whereby one can convert
        representations between different reference frames.
        Inspect :ref:`NXtransformations` for further details.

        Voxelization is the first step of the algorithmic chain that the 
        CompositionSpace tool implements. In this step all ion positions are
        discretized using a rectangular transfer function to identify the number
        of ions/atoms in the dataset of each iontype.
        
        Using a discretization grid that is larger than the average distance
        between reconstructed ion position reduces the computational costs.
        This is the key idea of the CompositionSpace tool over other methods
        traditionally used in atom probe (e.g. isosurfaces).

        Clustering is the third step of the algorithmic chain that the CompositionSpace
        tool implements. In this step the different voxelized regions in the dataset with
        eventually different chemical nature are analyzed if they are distributed in
        connected groups of voxels with the same chemical nature.
        Using the discretization grid from the first step as the support, this enables
        to prepare for the fourth step. In the fourth step the interfaces between
        identified groups of different chemical nature are triangulated.
        
        These triangulated network of interfaces between regions of different chemical
        nature is the final data structure that the CompositionSpace tool yields.
        Subsequently, this mesh can be post-processed, similarly like meshes that are
        obtained from isosurface-based approaches, to perform line profile analyses.
