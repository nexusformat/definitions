# A draft of a new base class to describe a waveplate

category: base
symbols:
  N_spectrum: |
    Size of the wavelength array for which the refractive index of the material
    and/or coating is given.
  N_wavelengths: |
    Number of discrete wavelengths for which the waveplate is designed. If it
    operates for a range of wavelengths then N_wavelengths = 2 and the minimum
    and maximum values of the range should be provided.

doc: |
  A waveplate or retarder.

NXwaveplate:
  type:
    doc: |
      Type of waveplate (e.g. achromatic waveplate or zero-order waveplate).
    # A waveplate can be e.g. a dual-wavelength multi-order plate
    # => multiple selection needs to be possible
    enumeration:
      [
        "zero-order waveplate",
        "achromatic waveplate",
        "multiple-order waveplate",
        "dual-wavelength waveplate",
        "other"
      ]
    # Are there any other common wave plate types?
  other_type:
    doc: If you selected 'other' in type describe what it is.

  retardance:
    doc: |
      Specify the retardance of the waveplate (e.g. full-wave, half-wave
      (lambda/2), quarter-wave (lambda/4) plate).
    enumeration:
      [
        "full-wave plate",
        "half-wave plate",
        "quarter-wave plate",
      ]

  wavelengths(NX_NUMBER):
    exists: recommended
    doc: |
      Discrete wavelengths for which the waveplate is designed. If the
      waveplate operates over an entire range of wavelengths, enter the minimum
      and maximum values of the wavelength range (in this case
      N_wavelengths = 2).

      substrate/substrate_material and provide its index of refraction in
      substrate/index_of_refraction_substrate, if known.

  coating(NXsample):
    doc: |
      Is the wave plate coated? If yes, specify the type and material of the
