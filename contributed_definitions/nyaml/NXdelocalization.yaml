  Base class of the configuration and results of a delocalization algorithm.
  
  Delocalization is used to distribute point-like objects on a grid to obtain
  e.g. smoother count, composition, or concentration values of scalar fields
  and compute gradients of these fields.

  # for APM the speciality is nothing but:
  # each point marks the location of an ion (object) in the tomographic reconstruction
  # there is a boolean mask which filters which ions, i.e. points are considered
  # plus there is a weight interpretation model, specifically in atom probe
  # if a (molecular) ion is decomposed into its atoms or isotopes
  # plus, given there is such a weight interpretation model, there is a weight
  # associated, specifically an integer >= 1 with each considered ion and 0 for
  # all ions which are not considered,
  # this weight is the multiplicity with respect to the interpretation model
  # i.e. a C:2 molecular ion has a multiplicity of 2 if the ion is considered
  # and the interpretation model that to consider carbon atoms or carbon ions

      The weighting model specifies how mark data are mapped to a weight per point/object.
    weighting_method(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        As an example from the research field of atom probe points/objects are (molecular) ions.
        Different methods are used for weighting ions:
        
        * default, points get all the same weight 1., which for atom probe is equivalent
           to (molecular) iontype-based delocalization.
        * element, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclide
          with a proton number that is matching to a respective entry in whitelist.
          In atom probe jargon, this means atomic_decomposition.
        * isotope, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclides
          from a respective entry in whitelist.
          In atom probe jargon, this means isotope_decomposition.

        A list of nuclides based on which to evaluate the weight. Nuclides need to exist in the nuclide table.
        Values are nuclide (isotope) hash values using the following hashing rule :math:`$H = Z + 256 * N$`
        with :math:`$Z$` the number of protons and :math:`$N$` the number of neutrons of the nuclide.
        For elements set :math:`$N$` to zero.
