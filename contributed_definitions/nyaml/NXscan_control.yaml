  A scan is performed inside an N-dimensional phase space, where each dimension can correspond not only to real space coordinates (x,y) but also to any other parameter. This class contains detailed information about controlling the scan in such a phase space (or its subspace).
  
  scan_types:
  Trajectory: A list of N-dimensional sequential vectors describes the trajectory line for a full scan.
  Mesh: For each dimension a range and a direction are chosen. When a scan along a dimension is done, a single step in the next dimension is taken, and then the scan in the previous dimension is repeated. As such we can speak about the fastest and the slowest scan axes.
  Snake: Similar to a mesh scan but with the scanning direction reversed after each line.
  Spiral: A scan taken along a spiral trajectory.
  Tilt: At each step, a proportional movement is done in all dimensions.
  Linear: A scan where the scanning will be performed along a single independent axis.
  
  Scan_control_types:
  Stepping: At each step, a movement to the next point is performed; correction (for example backlash) or active regulation (feedback loop) may or may not be applied. After the movement is done, the measurement is performed without the movement.
  Continuous: The scanning of each line in an N-dimensional phase space is done without stopping; measurements are done simultaneously with the movement.
  Oscillating: Scanning over a scan point continuously and then moving to start scanning at the next position.
