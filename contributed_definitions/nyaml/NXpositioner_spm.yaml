  a feedback loop, specialized for scanning probe microscopy applications.

NXpositioner_spm(NXpositioner):
  z_controller(NXpid):
    doc: |
      This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of the STM/STS tip in order
      to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set Point. Different control
      signals lead to different controller's behavior.
      
      The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
      
      p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller is the same as K_p_value from PID controller.
      i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller is the same as K_i_value from PID controller.
      setpoint from z_controller is the same as setpoint from PID controller.
  z_offset(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Offset added to the initial averaged position tip on Z-axis before starting to
      scan.
  tip_position_z(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      Indicate the tip position Z. The tip position can also be varied when the controller is not running.
      This is the final position after the tip reaches an equilibrium state.
  controller_name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Controller name. This name which will be displayed at places where you can select a
      controller.
