  Base class to hold different coordinate systems and representation conversions.
  
  How many nodes of type :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` should be used in an application definition?
  
  * 0; if there is no instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` and therein or elsewhere across
    the application definition, an instance of NXcoordinate_system is defined,
    the default NeXus `McStas <https://mailman2.mcstas.org/pipermail/mcstas-users/2021q2/001431.html>`_
    coordinate system is assumed. This makes :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` and
    NXcoordinate_system base classes backwards compatible to older
    NeXus conventions and classes.
  * 1; if only one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` is defined, it should be placed
    as high up in the node hierarchy (ideally right below an instance of NXentry)
    of the application definition tree as possible.
    This :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` should define at least one NXcoordinate_system
    instance. This shall be named such that it is clear how this coordinate system is
    typically referred to in a community. For the NeXus `McStas coordinate system, it is
    advised to call it mcstas for the sake of improved clarity.
    Additional NXcoordinate_system instances should be specified if possible in that same
    :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` instead of cluttering them across the tree.
    
    If this is the case, it is assumed that the NXcoordinate_system_members
    overwrite the NeXus default McStas coordinate system, i.e. users can thereby
    conveniently and explicitly specify the coordinate system(s) that
    they wish to use.
    
    Users are encouraged to write also explicit and clean depends_on fields in
    all groups that encode information about where the interpretation of coordinate
    systems is relevant. If these depends_on hints are not provided, it is
    automatically assumed that all children (to arbitrary depth)
    of that branch and sub-branches below the one in which that
    :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` is defined use either the only NXcoordinate_system_set
    instance in that set or the application definition is considered
    underconstrained which should at all costs be avoided and in which case
    again McStas is assumed.
  * 2 and more; as soon as more than one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` is specified
    somewhere in the tree, different interpretations are possible as to which
    of these coordinate system sets and instances apply or take preference.
    We realize that such ambiguities should at all costs be avoided.
    However, the opportunity for multiple sets and their instances enables to
    have branch-specific coordinate system conventions which could especially
    be useful for deep classes where multiple scientific methods are combined or
    cases where having a definition of global translation and conversion tables
    how to convert between representations in different coordinate systems
    is not desired or available for now.
    We argue that having 2 or more :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` instances and respective
    NXcoordinate_system instances makes the interpretation eventually unnecessary
    complicated. Instead, developers of application definitions should always try
    to work for clarity and thus use only one top-level coordinate system set.
  
  For these reasons we conclude that the option with one top-level
  :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` instance is the preferred choice.
  
  McStas is used if neither an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` nor an instance
  of NXcoordinate_system is specified. However, even in this case it is better
  to be explicit like for every other coordinate system definition to support
  users with interpreting the content and logic behind every instance of the tree.
  
  How to store coordinate systems inside :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`?
  Individual coordinate systems should be specified as members of the
  :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` instance using instances of NXcoordinate_system.
  
  How many individual instances of NXcoordinate_system to allow within one
  instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`?
  
  * 0; This case should be avoided for the sake of clarity but this case could
    mean the authors of the definition meant that McStas is used. We conclude,
    McStas is used in this case.
  * 1; Like above-mentioned this case has the advantage that it is explicit
    and faces no ambiguities. However, in reality typically multiple
    coordinate systems have to be mastered especially for complex
    multi-signal modality experiments.
  * 2 or more; If this case is realized, the best practice is that in every
    case where a coordinate system should be referred to the respective class
    has a depends_on field which resolves the possible ambiguities which specific
    coordinate systems is referred to. The benefit of this explicit and clear
    specifying of the coordinate system used in every case is that especially
    in combination with having coordinate systems inside deeper branches
    makes up for a very versatile, backwards compatible, but powerful system
    to express different types of coordinate systems using NeXus. In the case
    of two or more instances of NXcoordinate_system in one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`,
    it is also advised to specify the relationship between the two coordinate systems by
    using the (NXtransformations) group within NXcoordinate_system.
  
  In effect, 1 should be the preferred choice. However, if more than one coordinate
  system is defined for practical purposes, explicit depends_on fields should
  always guide the user for each group and field which of the coordinate system
  one refers to.
