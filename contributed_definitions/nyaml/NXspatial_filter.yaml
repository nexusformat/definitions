      Qualitative statement which specifies which spatial filtering with respective
      geometric primitives or bitmask is used. These settings are possible:
      
      * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, the entire dataset is used.  
      * union_of_primitives, a filter with (rotated) geometric primitives.  
        All ions in or on the surface of the primitives are considered  
        while all other ions are ignored.  
      * bitmasked_points, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1  
        which ions should be included. Those ions whose bit is set to 0  
        will be excluded. Users of python can use the bitfield operations  
        of the numpy package to define such bitfields.  
      
      Conditions:
      In the case that windowing_method is entire_dataset all entries are processed.
      In the case that windowing_method is union_of_primitives,
      it is possible to specify none or all types of primitives
      (ellipsoids, cylinder, hexahedra). If no primitives are specified
      the filter falls back to entire_dataset.
      In the case that windowing_method is bitmask, the bitmask has to be defined;
      otherwise the filter falls back to entire dataset.
