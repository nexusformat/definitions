  Computer science description of a profiling event.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_processes: Number of processes.
NXcs_profiling_event:
  start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the event tracking started.
  end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the event tracking ended.
  description:
    doc: |
      Free-text description what was monitored/executed during the event.
  elapsed_time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Wall-clock time how long the event took. This may be in principle
      end_time minus start_time; however usage of eventually more precise timers
      may warrant to use a finer temporal discretization,
      and thus demand a more precise record of the wall-clock time.
      Elapsed time may contain time portions where resources were idling.

    doc: |
      Number of processes used (max) during the execution of this event.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  number_of_threads(NX_POSINT):
    doc: |
      Number of threads used (max) during the execution of this event.

    doc: |
      Number of GPUs used (max) during the execution of this event.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  max_virtual_memory_snapshot(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Maximum amount of virtual memory allocated per process during the event.
