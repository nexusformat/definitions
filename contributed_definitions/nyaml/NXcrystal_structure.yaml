  Base class to describe the atomic crystal structure of a phase.
  
  This base class contains key metadata that are relevant parameter to every
  physics-based model to simulate radiation matter interaction.
  
  Examples where such base class is useful are kinematic or dynamic
  diffraction simulations of e.g. (Kikuchi or other type of) patterns.
# The actual indexing of Kikuchi patterns may use different algorithms.
# Such are used within different workflows where simulated and measured
# Kikuchi pattern are compared to rate which phase and orientation is the most
# likely candidate describing the pattern measured at that each scan point
# respectively. If this evaluation yields scan points without any solutions,
# these are represented using the null-phase model phase0, aka n/a aka notIndexed.
# Traditionally, Hough transformation-based indexing has been the most frequently
# used algorithm. Dictionary-based alternatives are emerging.

      Centrosymmetric has all types and combinations of symmetry elements
      (translation, rotational axis, mirror planes, center of inversion)

  phase_identifier(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Identifier for each phase.
      
      The value 0 is reserved for the unknown phase that represents the
      null-model no sufficiently significant confirmation. In other words,
      the phase_name is n/a, notIndexed.
      
      The phase identifier value has to match with the integer postfix of the
      group name which represents that instance in a NeXus/HDF5 file, i.e.
      if two phases were used e.g. 0 and 1, two instances of an
      :ref:`NXcrystal_structure` named phase0 and phase1
      should be stored in the HDF5 file.

      Name of the phase/alias.
      
      If the phase_identifier is 0 and one would like to use the field
      phase_name the value should be n/a.
