  Corrector for aberrations in an electron microscope.
  
  Different vendors use a different naming schemes for aberration coefficients.
  It is the users responsibility to map to the best matching values.
  
  In transmission electron microscopes the spherical aberration corrector is
  a component that is controlled via instructing the microscope to achieve
  set point values. The corrector is composed of multiple lenses and other
  parts with vendor-specific details which are often undisclosed.
  
  In the case of Nion Co. microscopes the coefficients of the corrector can be
  retrieved via NionSwift, which is why currently the Nion convention for the
  aberration coefficients is used.
