  :ref:`NXprocess_photoemission` describes events of data processing, reconstruction,
  or analysis for photoemission-related data.
   
  It extends the NXprocess class and provides a glossary of explicitly named processes
  and their metadata which are typical for photoemission data.
  
  For now, the extension of NXprocess is performed by simply copying all existing groups, fields,
  and attibute from NXprocess. In the future, it is envisioned that this extension can be solved by
  base class inheritance.

      For energy referencing, the measured energies are corrected for the charging potential
      (i.e., the electrical potential of the surface region of an insulating sample, caused by
      irradiation) such that those energies correspond to a sample with no surface charge.
      Usually, the energy axis is adjusted by shifting all energies uniformally until one
      well-defined emission line peak (or the Fermi edge) is located at a known _correct_ energy.

#              In the transmission correction, each intensity measurement for electrons of a given
#              kinetic energy is multiplied by the corresponding value in the relative_intensity
#              field of the transmission_function. This calibration procedure is used to account for
#              the different tranmsission efficiencies when using different lens modes.

#                  
#                  The transmission function (TF) specifies the detection efficiency for electrons of
#                  different kinetic energy passing through the electron analyser.
