  A general application definition of optical spectroscopy elements, which may 
  be used as a template to derive specialized optical spectroscopy experiments.
  
  Possible specializations are ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
  reflectivity/transmission spectroscopy.

  A general optical experiment consists of (i) a light/photon source, (ii) a sample,
  (iii) a detector.

  For any free text descriptions, it is recommended to enter data in english
  language, as this is the most FAIR representation.
symbols:
  doc: |
    Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions or parameters.
  N_spectrum: |
    Length of the spectrum array (e.g. wavelength or energy) of the measured
    data.
  N_measurements: |
    Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is
    equal to the number of parameters scanned. For example, if the experiment
    was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures
    N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.

# 04/2024
# Extension of the Draft Version (05/2023) of a NeXus application definition which
# serves as a template for various optical spectroscopy experiments
#
# TODO:
# - Add NXlens_opt and NXwaveplate to NXinstrument?
# - Make polfilter_TYPE(NXbeam_device) own base class --> rework NXpolarizer_opt. and add them to NXinstrument.
# - Make spectralfilter_TYPE(NXbeam_device) own base class --> extend NXfilter?  and add them to NXinstrument.
# - Make offset angles for polar and azimutal? 
# - Can angle_reference_frame be replaced later by only using reference_frames and generic angle description?
# - Add optical elements and rework them: NXfiber, NXbeam_splitter, 
# - Consider to make power flux recommended? Difficult parameter to measure. Relevant for some samples/techniques, but not for all. Powder density? Nominal vs. measured?
# - Is there something to describe the spot size?

        Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
        by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
        into this field.

        The reason is that such a free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
        The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn how far the
        current base classes need extension based on user feedback.
