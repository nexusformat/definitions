doc: |
  Container for reporting a set of annular dark field images.
  
  Virtually the most important case is that spectra are collected in 
  a scanning microscope (SEM or STEM) for a collection of points.
  The majority of cases use simple d-dimensional regular scan pattern,
  such as single point, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
  The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
  
  For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
  binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
symbols:
  n_images: Number of images in the stack.
  n_y: Number of pixel per image in the slow direction.
  n_x: Number of pixel per image in the fast direction.
NXimage_set_em_adf:
  (NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details how (HA)ADF images were processed from the detector readings.
    source:
      doc: |
        Typically the name of the input, (vendor) file from which all
        the NXdata instances in this NXimage_set_em_adf were loaded during
        parsing to represent them in e.g. databases.
      \@version:
        doc: |
          An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the dataset/file
          which represents the source digitally to support provenance tracking.
    program:
      doc: |
        Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
        to process detector data into the adf image(s).
      \@version:
        doc: |
          Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description
          of an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
          and build instructions can be found so that the program
          can be configured in such a manner that the result file
          is ideally recreatable yielding the same results.
