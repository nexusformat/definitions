  A set of (eventually directed) edges which connect nodes/vertices of a graph.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_edges: The number of edges.
NXgraph_edge_set:
  number_of_edges(NX_POSINT):
    doc: Total number of edges, counting eventual bidirectional edges only once.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  identifier_offset(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
      edges. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
      or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
      interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
      For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
      
      The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
      identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
      or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

  directionality(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Specifier whether each edge is non-directional, one-directional,
      or bidirectional. Use the smallest available binary representation
      which can store three different states:
      
      * 0 / state 0x00 is non-directional
      * 1 / state 0x01 is one-directional
      * 2 / state 0x02 is bi-directional

  node_pair(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Pairs of node/vertex identifier. Each pair represents the connection 
      between two nodes.
      
      In the case that the edge is non- or bi-directional
      node identifier should be stored in ascending order is preferred.
      
      In the case of one-directional, for each pair the identifier of the source
      node is the first entry in the pair. The identifier of the target is the
      second entry in the pair, i.e. the pair encodes the information as 
      if one traverses the edge from the source node walking to the target node.

    doc: |
      A human-readable qualifier which type or e.g. class instance the
      edge is an instance of.

  label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: A human-readable label/caption/tag for the edge.
