      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
      snapshots. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
      or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
      interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
      For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
      
      The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
      identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
      or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
