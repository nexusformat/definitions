  Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).
  
  Whenever possible, an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` should be used as
  a member in an :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` and the name of the instance
  should be this alias. This may support a process whereby jargon when talking
  about coordinate systems and conventions may become cleaner for users
  because it is not evident for people outside a lab that terms like e.g.
  tip space or specimen space refer to the same coordinate system.
  This is an example of jargon used in e.g. the field of atom
  probe tomography.

NXcoordinate_system(NXobject):
  origin(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable field telling where the origin of this CS is.
      Exemplar values could be *left corner of the lab bench*, *door-handle*
      *pinhole through which the electron beam exists the pole piece*.
      *barycenter of the triangle*, *center of mass of the stone*.
  # implementing a proposal for "a common base table" along thoughts like:

  # similar to a place where all transformations are stored

  alias(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      An alternative name given to that coordinate system.
  type(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Coordinate system type.
    enumeration: [cartesian]
  handedness(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Handedness of the coordinate system if it is a Cartesian.
    enumeration: [right_handed, left_handed]
  x_alias(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Possibility to define an alias for the name of the x-axis.
  x_direction(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable field telling in which direction the x-axis points if that
      instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` has no reference to any parent and as such
      is the mighty world reference frame.
      
      Exemplar values could be direction of gravity.
  x(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the first axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the x-axis in real space and
      the i-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
  y_alias(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Possibility to define an alias for the name of the y-axis.
  y_direction(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable field telling in which direction the y-axis points if that
      instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` has no reference to any parent and as such
      is the mighty world reference frame.
      
      See docstring of x_alias for further details.
  y(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the second axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the y-axis in real space and
      the j-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
  z_alias(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Possibility to define an alias for the name of the z-axis.
  z_direction(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable field telling in which direction the z-axis points if that
      instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` has no reference to any parent and as such
      is the mighty world reference frame.
      
      See docstring of x_alias for further details.
  z(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Base unit vector along the second axis which spans the coordinate system.
      This axis is frequently referred to as the z-axis in real space and
      the k-axis in reciprocal space.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (3,)
