  Contains datastructures of an experimental optical setup (i.e., multiple 
  transfermatrix tables).   These datastructures are used to relate physical
  properties of two beams (NXbeam) which have one common optical element
  (NXopt_element) (one specific transfermatrix).
  One of these beams in an input beam and the other one is an output beam.

  The data describes the change of beam properties, e.g. the intensity of a 
  beam is reduced because the transmission coefficient of the beam device is
  lower than 1.

      Select which type of data was recorded, for example aperture and
      focal length.
      It is possible to have multiple selections. This selection defines
      how many columns (N_variables) are stored in the data array.
      N in the name, is the index number in which order the given
      property is listed. 
    enumeration:
      [
        aperture,
        focallength,
        orientation,
        jones matrix,
      ]

      Please list in this array the column and row names used in your actual data.
      That is in the case of aperture ['diameter'] or focal length ['focal_length_value']
      and for orientation matrix ['OM1', 'OM2', 'OM3'] or for jones matrix
      ['JM1','JM2']

  TRANSFER_MATRIX(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Contains the datastructure which relates beam properties of an 
      input and output beam as result of the input beam interaction
      with the beam device.

      Transfermatrix relationship between N input beams and M output beams.
      It contains a table with the relevant matricis to be used for different
      transmissitted properties (such as polarization, intensity, phase).

      Data structure for all transfermatrices of an beam device in a setup.
      For each combination of N input and M output beams and for L physical
      concept (i.e. beam intensity), one matrix can be defined.

      In this way, the transfermatrix table has the dimension NxM.

      For each entry, in this transfermatrix, there are L formalisms.
      Each formalism has the dimension math:`dim(L_i)xdim(L_i)`,
      whereby math:`L_i` is the specific physical concept (Intensity, polarization, direction).

      A beamsplitter with two input laser beams can have a total of
      four transfermatrices (2 Input x 2 Output).

      The dimension of the transfermatrix depends on the parameters.
      Examples are:
      1x1 for intensity/power
      2x2 for jones formalism
      3x3 for direction
