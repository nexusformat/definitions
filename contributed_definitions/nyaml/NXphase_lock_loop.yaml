  A base class definition for a phase-locked loop (PLL) used in AFM experiments.
  
  The PLL has three main components:
    1. Phase-detector
    2. Loop-filter
    3. Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)
    
  Depending on the phase error from the phase detector due to the phase difference between the
  Reference and output from the VCO signals, the PLL adjusts the output frequency to minimize the phase error.
  
  Measuring the phase error, the PLL can be in one of three states:
    - Zero phase error: The output signal is in coherence with the reference signal (lock condition).
    - Constant phase error: The output signal has a constant phase difference from the reference signal, and therefore,
            both reference signals have the same frequency (lock condition).
    - Continuous increasing phase error: The output signal's phase continuously changes therefore they have different frequencies,
            indicating the PLL is in an unlock condition.
