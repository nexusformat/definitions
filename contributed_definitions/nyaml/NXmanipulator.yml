      "Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and geometry of the manipulator as a component in the instrument.
      Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used.
      The first transformation has to point either to another component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it relative to the experimental setup.
      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to the reference coordinate system."
