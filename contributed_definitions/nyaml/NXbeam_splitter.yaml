  A beam splitter, i.e. a device splitting the light into two or more beams.

  Information about types and properties of beam splitters is provided e.g.
  [here](https://www.rp-photonics.com/beam_splitters.html).

  Use two or more NXbeam_paths to describe the beam paths after the beam
  splitter. In the dependency chain of the new beam paths, the first elements
  each point to this beam splitter, as this is the previous element.

NXbeam_splitter:
  type:
    doc: |
      Specify the beam splitter type (e.g. dielectric mirror, pellicle,
      dichroic mirror etc.). Shape (e.g. prism, plate, cube) and dimension
      should be described in 'geometry'. Define if the beam splitter is
      polarizing or not in the field 'polarizing(NX_BOOLEAN)'.
    enumeration:
      [
        "dichroic mirror",
        "dielectric mirror",
        "metal-coated mirror",
        "Nicol prism",
        "Glan-Thompson prism",
        "pellicle mirror",
        "Polka dot beam splitter",
        "fiber optic splitter",
        "other"
      ]
    # ??? Are there any other common types of beam splitters ???
  other_type:
    doc: |
      If you selected 'other' in 'type' use this field to specify which type of
      beam splitter was used.

  polarizing(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: Is the beam splitter polarizing?

  multiple_outputs(NX_BOOLEAN):
  # ??? Redundant because number of outputs is defined by N_outputs ???
    doc: |
      Does the beam splitter have multiple outputs (diffractive optical
      element), i.e. more than two outputs?

  (NXshape):
    exists: recommended
    doc: |
      Describe the geometry (shape, dimension etc.) of the beam splitter.
      Specify the dimensions in 'SHAPE/size'. A sketch of the device should be
      provided in the 'sketch(NXdata)' field to clarify (i) the shape and
      dimensions of the device, and (ii) the input and outputs (i.e. the
      direction of the incoming and outcoming (split) beams).
    # Specify the length and height if the surface facing the incident
    # beam is a square or rectangle. Otherwise, if the device has a round
    # geometry (disc), sepcify the diameter instead.
    # The thickness or depth of the device should be defined in 'depth',
    # while the thickness of the substrate and coating should be specified
    # in 'substrate/substrate_thickness' and 'coating/coating_thickness'.
    shape:
      doc: Describe the shape (plate, cube, wedged, prism etc.).
      enumeration:
        [
          cube,
          cylinder,
          plate,
          prism,
          wedged,
          other
        ]
    other_shape:
      doc: If you chose 'other' in 'shape' describe what it is.
    sketch(NXdata):
      doc: |
        Sketch of the beam splitter showing its geometry. The paths of the
        incoming and split beam should be illustrated and labelled (0 for the
        incoming beam, and 1, 2,..., N_outputs for the outputs (i.e. the split
        beam paths)).
    size:
      doc: |
        Physical extent of the beam splitter device. The beam splitter might be
        made up of one or more objects (NX_objects). The meaning and location
        of the axes used will vary according to the value of the 'shape'
        variable. 'N_shapepar' defines how many parameters:

        * For 'cube' the parameters are (width, length).
        * For 'cylinder' the parameters are (diameter, length).
        * For 'plate' the parameters are (width, height, length).
        * For 'prism' the parameters are (width, height, length).
        * For 'wedged' the parameters are (width, height, shortest length).
          The wedge angle should be provided in 'SHAPE/wedge_angle'.
        * For 'other' the parameters may be (A, B, C, ...) with the labels
          defined in the sketch plotted in 'SHAPE/sketch'.
