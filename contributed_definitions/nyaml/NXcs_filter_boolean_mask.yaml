  Base class for packing and unpacking booleans.
  
  This base class bookkeeps metadata to inform software about necessary modulo
  operations to decode e.g. set membership of objects in sets which are encoded
  as a packed array of boolean values.
  
  One use case is processing of object sets (e.g. point cloud data). If e.g. a
  spatial filter has been applied to a set of points we may wish to store
  document efficiently which points were analyzed. Array of boolean values
  is one option to achieve this. A value is true if the point is included.
  The resulting boolean array will be filled with true and false values
  in a manner that is often arbitrary and in general case-dependent.
  
  Especially when the number of points is large, for instance several thousands
  or more, some situations can be more efficiently stored if one does not store
  the boolean array but just lists the identifiers of the points taken.
  
  For example, if within a set of 1000 points only one point is included, it would
  take (naively) 4000 bits to store the array but only 32 bits to store e.g. the
  ID of the single point that is taken. Of course the 4000 bit field is so
  sparse that it could be compressed resulting also in a substantial reduction
  of the storage demands. Therefore, boolean masks are useful in that
  they store compact representation of set memberships.
  
  This base class can deal with the situation when the number of objects
  is not an integer multiple of the bit depth used for storing the states.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_objs: |
    Number of entries (e.g. number of points or objects).
  bitdepth: |
    Number of bits assumed for the container datatype used.
  n_total: |
    Length of mask considering the eventual need for padding.
type: group
NXcs_filter_boolean_mask(NXobject):
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Possibility to refer to which set this mask applies.
      
      If depends_on is not provided, it is assumed that the mask
      applies to its direct parent.
  number_of_objects(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Number of objects represented by the mask.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  bitdepth(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Number of bits assumed matching on a default datatype.
      (e.g. 8 bits for a C-style uint8). 
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  mask(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      The content of the mask. If padding is used, 
      padding bits have to be set to 0.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (n_total,)
  identifier(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Link to/or array of identifiers for the objects. The decoded mask is
      interpreted consecutively, i.e. the first bit in the mask matches
      to the first identifier, the second bit in the mask to the second
      identifier and so on and so forth. Resolving of identifier follows
      the conventions made for depends_on, so consult also the description
      of th content to which depends_on refers.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (n_object,)
