# template to be used for an application definition
doc: |
  Blue-print of a generic appdef for electron microscopy research formulated as a deep base class.
  
  This base class combines a method-specific and technical-design-level base class
  instance to provide a template for storing parameterized descriptions of
  pieces of information collected when performing electron microscopy research.
  
  The base class here shows all possible branches without making any statements
  as to which of these have to be used in an instance. Thereby, the base class
  provides a template how to name and structure concepts in a hierarchy
  to support finding information and reducing the need for renaming and
  restructuring information for a research field where many scientists perform
  very specific research but who all also share commonalities like usage of
  controlled electron beams, a focus on studies of electron beam matter interaction
  to explore physical mechanisms and phenomena, or the desire to characterize materials
  using electron microscopy.
# flesh out the description of that to read the docs, because currently the
# description on the NeXus front-page is overwhelming
# considering what we learned from the diataxis workshop we write here a
# specification neither a how to nor a tutorial which explains all the context
# because we address here developers of software
type: group
NXem_base(NXobject):  # but should inherit from NXroot
  # each NeXus file instance should have a default plot
  # however as there are cases when this cannot be assured we cannot
  # make the default required, one example is e.g. a NeXus instance
  # where scientists just store conventions without a default plot
  (NXentry):  # means ENTRY(NXentry)
    \@version(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the file
        which specifies the application definition.
    definition(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        NeXus NXDL schema to which this file conforms.
      enumeration: [NXem]
    cs_profiling(NXcs_profiling):
      doc: |
        The configuration of the I/O writer software (e.g. `pynxtools <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_)
        which was used to generate this NeXus file instance.
      (NXprogram):  # understood by default as PROGRAM(NXprogram), i.e. program1, program2, ...
        doc: |
          A collection of all programs and libraries which are considered relevant
          to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
          generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
          
          Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
          instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
          also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific
          set of base classes, application definitions, and  contributed definitions
          with which the here described concepts can be resolved.
          
          For the `pynxtools library <https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools>`_
          which is used by the `NOMAD <https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab>`_
          research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
          repository commit and respective submodule references used.
    experiment_identifier(NXidentifier):
      doc: |
        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier
        for referring to this experiment.
        
        An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
        in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an
        experiment (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment: 
        *a test done in order to find out something, eg if an idea is correct*).
        
        The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory,
        or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
        experiments/simulations to e.g. proposals.
    experiment_description(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to parameterize their description of the
        experiment by using the respective base classes instead of writing prose
        into this field.
        
        The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
        The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn through
        the information entered in this field in how far the current base
        classes are incomplete.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
        when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
        codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
        for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
        duration is not relevant - this start_time field should be used.
        
        Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both
        a start_time and an end_time because this enables software tools and
        users to collect a more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
        
        The user should be aware that even with having both time instances specified,
        it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or for how
        long data were acquired.
        
        More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
        to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
        advantage of individual time stamps start_time and end_time
        in :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.
    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included when
        the microscope session ended. See docstring of the start_time field
        to see how the start_time and end_time should be used together.
    (NXcite):
    (NXserialized):
      doc: |
        Possibility to store a collection of serialized resources
        that are associated with the experiment.
        
        An example how to use this set could be to document
        from which files generated by software of technology partners
        the information in an instance of NXem was filled.
        
        If resources from technology partners would also be documented
        semantically annotated there would not even be a necessity to
        copy over specific information in NeXus files as one could write
        a inference and information/fact/knowledge retrieval algorithm whereby
        a specific piece of information that is related to an experiment or simulation
        is just read directly from the respective file of the technology partner.
        
        The reason why currently this works convincingly in hardly any research
        data management system is the strong heterogeneity of the information contained
        in such files and the fact that often context and documentation specifically
        rich semantic documentation and contextualization is missing.
      # using NXserialized here instead of NXnote as the former is more specific
    (NXuser):
      doc: |
        Contact information and eventually details of at least one person
        who performed or was involved in the session. This can be the
        principle investigator who performed this experiment or the student
        who performed the simulation.
        Adding multiple users if relevant is recommended.
      name(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Given (first) name and surname of the user.
      affiliation(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Name of the affiliation of the user at the point in time
          when the experiment was performed.
      address(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Postal address of the affiliation.
      email(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Email address of the user at the point in time when the experiment
          was performed. Writing the most permanently used email is recommended.
      identifier(NXidentifier):
        doc: |
          Service as another mean of identification of a user than by the name.
          Examples could be details about an ORCID or social media account of
          the user.
      telephone_number(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          (Business) (tele)phone number of the user at the point
          in time when the experiment was performed.
      role(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          Which role does the user have in the place and at the point
          in time when the experiment was performed? Technician operating
          the microscope, student, postdoc, principle investigator, or guest
          are common examples.

      identifier(NXidentifier):
        doc: |
          Ideally, (globally) unique persistent identifier which distinguishes
          the specimen from all others and especially the predecessor/origin
          from where the specimen was cut. 
          
          This field must not be used for an alias! Instead, use name.
          
          In cases where multiple specimens were loaded into the microscope,
          the identifier has to resolve the specific sample, whose results are
          stored by this :ref:`NXentry` instance, because a single NXentry should be
          used only for the characterization of a single specimen.
          
          Details about the specimen preparation should be
          stored in resources referring to parent_identifier.
      parent_identifier(NXidentifier):
        doc: |
          Identifier of the sample from which the sample was cut or the string
          *None*. The purpose of this field is to support functionalities
          for tracking sample provenance via a research data management system.
      preparation_date(NX_DATE_TIME):
        doc: |
          ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
          when the specimen was prepared.
          
          Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
          the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Ideally, this
          matches the last timestamp that is mentioned in the digital resource
          pointed to by parent_identifier.
          
          Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
          especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
          hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
          short half time. Additional time stamps prior to preparation_date
          should better be placed in resources which describe but which do not pollute
          the description here with prose. Resolving these connected pieces of information
          is considered within the responsibility of the research data management
          system.
      name(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          An alias used to refer to the specimen to please readability for humans.
      atom_types(NX_CHAR):
        doc: |
          List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table that are
          contained in the sample. If the sample substance has multiple
          components, all elements from each component must be included in
          `atom_types`.
          
          The purpose of the field is to offer research data management systems an
          opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
          these from the resources pointed to by parent_identifier or walk through
          eventually deeply nested groups in data instances.

          (Measured) sample thickness.
          
          The information is recorded to qualify if the beam used was likely
          able to shine through the specimen. For scanning electron microscopy,
          in many cases the specimen is typically thicker than what is
          illuminatable by the electron beam.
          
          In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of
          the specimen viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal
          surface normal of the specimen is parallel to the optical axis.

          the usage of this field is discouraged and instead an instance of an 
          :ref:`NXinteraction_vol_em` within individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
          instances can provide a cleaner description of the relevant details
          why one may wish to store the density of the specimen.
