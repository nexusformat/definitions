  Description of an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.
  
  For NXtransformations the origin of the coordinate system is placed
  in the center of the lens
  (its polepiece, pinhole, or another point of reference).
  The origin should be specified in the NXtransformations.
  
  For details of electro-magnetic lenses in the literature see e.g. `L. Reimer <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-38967-5>`_

    doc: Qualitative type of lens with respect to the number of pole pieces.
    enumeration: [single, double, quadrupole, hexapole, octupole]

      Given name, alias, colloquial, or short name for the lens.
      For manufacturer names and identifiers use respective manufacturer fields.
  manufacturer_name:
    doc: Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the lens.
  (NXfabrication):
  model:
    doc: Hardware name, hash identifier, or serial number that was given by the manufacturer to identify the lens.
  description:
    doc: Ideally an identifier, persistent link, or free text which gives further details about the lens.
  voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Excitation voltage of the lens. For dipoles it is a single number. For higher orders, it is an array.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  current(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Excitation current of the lens. For dipoles it is a single number. For higher orders, it is an array.
    unit: NX_CURRENT
  value(NX_NUMBER):

      This field should be used when the exact voltage or current of the lens is not directly controllable
      as the control software of the microscope does not enable users/or is was not configured to enable
      the user to retrieve these values. In this case this field should be used to specify the value as
      read from the control software. Although consumers of the application definition should not expect
      this value to represent the exact physical voltage or excitation, it is still useful to know though
      as it allows other users to reuse this lens setting, which, provided a properly working instrument
      and software should bring the lenses into a similar state.
    unit: NX_ANY
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: Specifies the position of the lens by pointing to the last transformation in the transformation chain in the NXtransformations group.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the
      location and geometry of the lens as a component in the instrument.
      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
      each other and only one component should relate to the reference
      coordinate system.
