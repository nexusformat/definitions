        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier, link,
        or text to a resource which gives further details.
    # NEW ISSUE: details about the life/up-time of the source

  (NXsensor):
    doc: |
      A sensor used to monitor an external or internal condition.
  (NXbeam):
    doc: |
      Individual ocharacterization results for the position, shape,
      and characteristics of the electron beam.
      
      NXtransformations should be used to specify the location
      of the position at which the beam was probed.
