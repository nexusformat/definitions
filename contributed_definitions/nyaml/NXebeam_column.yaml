  Base class for a set of components providing a controllable electron beam.

# NXebeam_column is an NXobject instead of an NXcomponent_em to make that
# part "an electron gun" reusable in other context
NXebeam_column(NXobject):
  operation_mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Typically tech-partner, microscope-, and control software-specific
      name of the specific operation mode how the ebeam_column and its
      components are controlled to achieve a specific illumination condition.
      
      In most cases users do not know, have to care, or are able to disentangle the
      details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the components of the microscope.
      Instead, they rely on the assumption that the microscope and control software
      work as expected. Selecting then a specific operation_mode assures some level
      of reproducibility in the illumination conditions.
