  Base class for collecting a session with a real electron microscope.
  
  For collecting data and experiments which are simulations of an
  electron microscope use the :ref:`NXem_sim` base class.

      (Meta)data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.
      
      This em_lab group differs from potential em_lab groups inside
      :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances in that here the more static descriptions
      are kept while changing, i.e. time-dependent pieces of information are
      logged, via the em_lab group inside the desired number of instances
      of NXevent_data_em.
      
      While using an :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instance, users should store only those
      settings about a component which are relevant to understand the current
      state of the component. Here, current means for the time interval which
      the event covers (as it is detailed via start_time and end_time) timestamps.
      
      For example it is not relevant to store in each :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
      electron_source group again the details of the gun type and the manufacturer
      but only the high-voltage value and that only if it is different from the value
      that is specified in the em_lab section for the static settings.
      
      In effect, this defines an information inference hierarchy which starts
      in an individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instance followed by a probing of the
      static section.

        Given name of the microscope at the hosting institution.
        This is an alias. Examples could be NionHermes, Titan, JEOL,
        Gemini, etc.

      doc: |
        Location of the lab or place where the instrument is installed.
        Using GEOREF is preferred.

        Description of the type of the detector.
        
        Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
        Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator,
        direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.
