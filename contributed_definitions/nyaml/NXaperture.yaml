  A beamline aperture

type: group
(NXobject)NXaperture:
  \@default:
    doc: |       
      Declares which child group contains a path leading to a ':'ref':'`NXdata` group.
      
      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute to help define the path to the
      default dataset to be plotted.
      See https':'//www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
  material(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      Absorbing material of the aperture.
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      Description of the aperture.
  shape(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      Shape of the aperture.
    enumeration: [straight slit, curved slit, pinhole, circle, square, hexagon, octagon, bladed, open, grid]
  size(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |       
      The relevant dimension for the aperture, i.e. slit width, pinhole and iris
      diameter
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      Specifies the position of the aperture by pointing to the last transformation in
      the transformation chain in the NXtransformations group.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |       
      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and
      geometry of the deflector as a component in the instrument. Conventions from the
      NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
      system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
      component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
      relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
      all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
      the reference coordinate system.
  (NXpositioner):
    doc: |       
      Stores the raw positions of aperture motors.
  (NXgeometry):
    doc: |       
      Location and shape of the aperture.
  BLADE_GEOMETRY(NXgeometry):
    doc: |       
      Location and shape of each blade.
  (NXnote):

      Describes any additional information.
