      This is the application definition describing ellipsometry experiments.

      Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a reflected
      beam of light with a single wavelength changes its polarization state,
      to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry experiment.

      The application definition defines:

      * elements of the experimental instrument
      * calibration information if available
      * parameters used to tune the state of the sample
      * sample description
