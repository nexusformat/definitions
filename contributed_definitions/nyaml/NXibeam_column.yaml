  Base class for a set of components equipping an instrument with FIB capabilities.
  
  Focused-ion-beam (FIB) capabilities turn especially scanning electron microscopes
  into specimen preparation labs. FIB is a material preparation technique whereby
  portions of the sample are illuminated with a focused ion beam with controlled
  intensity. The beam is intense enough and with sufficient ion momentum to
  remove material in a controlled manner.
  
  The fact that an electron microscope with FIB capabilities has needs a
  second gun with own relevant control circuits, focusing lenses, and other
  components, warrants the definition of an own base class to group these
  components and distinguish them from the lenses and components for creating
  and shaping the electron beam.
