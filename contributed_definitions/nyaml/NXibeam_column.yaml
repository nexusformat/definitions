  Container for components of a focused-ion-beam (FIB) system.
  
  FIB capabilities turn especially scanning electron microscopes
  into specimen preparation labs. FIB is a material preparation
  technique whereby portions of the sample are illuminated with a
  focused ion beam with controlled intensity intense enough and with
  sufficient ion momentum to remove material in a controllable manner.
  
  The fact that an electron microscope with FIB capabilities has needs a
  second gun with own relevant control circuits, focusing lenses, and
  other components, warrants an own base class to group these components
  and distinguish them from the lenses and components for creating and
  shaping the electron beam.

      Individual characterization results for the position, shape,
      and characteristics of the ion beam.
      
      NXtransformations should be used to specify the location or position
      at which details about the ion beam are probed.

  #      A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used whose positive 
  #      z-axis points in the direction of the ion beam, i.e. towards the
  #      sample. For modelling ion milling it is relevant to document the
  #      illumination vector. NXtransformations offers a place to store how the
  #      ion gun coordinate system has to be rotated to align its positive z-axis
  #      with the positive z-axis of e.g. the electron beam and ion beam
  #      respectively.
