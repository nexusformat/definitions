  Base class for method-specific conventions EBSD.
  
  This base class is expected to be used with :ref:`NXem_conventions`.
  
  This is the main issue which currently is not in all cases documented
  and thus limits the interoperability and value of collected EBSD data.
  Not communicating EBSD data with such contextual pieces of information
  and the use of file formats which do not store this information is the
  key unsolved problem.

      Details about the gnomonic projection reference frame.

      doc: |
        Type of coordinate system/reference frame used for identifying
        positions in the gnomonic projection space Xg, Yg, Zg

    origin(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Is the origin of the gnomonic coordinate system located
        where we assume the location of the pattern centre.
        This is the location Xg = 0, Yg = 0, Zg = 0 according to

    x_direction(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Direction of the positively pointing "gnomomic" x-axis base
        vector when viewing how the diffraction pattern looks on the
        detector screen. We assume the configuration is inspected by
        looking towards the sample surface from a position
        that is located behind the detector.
        Different tools assume that different strategies can be used
        and are perceived as differently convenient to enter
        details about coordinate system definitions. In this ELN users
        have to possibility to fill in what they assume is sufficient to
        define the coordinate system directions unambiguously.
        Software which works with this user input needs to offer parsing
        capabilities which detect conflicting input and warn accordingly.

        Direction of the positively pointing "gnomomic" y-axis base
        vector when viewing how the diffraction pattern looks on the
        detector screen. We assume the configuration is inspected by
        looking towards the sample surface from a position

  pattern_centre(NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details about the definition of the pattern centre
      as a special point in the gnomonic projection reference frame.
    x_boundary_convention(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        From which border of the EBSP (in the detector reference frame)
        is the pattern centre's x-position (PCx) measured?
        Keywords assume the region-of-interest is defined by
        a rectangle. We observe this rectangle and inspect the
        direction of the outer-unit normals to the edges of
        this rectangle.
      enumeration: [undefined, top, right, bottom, left]
    x_normalization_direction(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        In which direction are positive values for PCx measured from
        the specified boundary. Keep in mind that the gnomonic space
        is in virtually all cases embedded in the detector space.
        Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is
        embedded/laying inside the XdYd plane (of the detector
        reference frame).
        When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the
        detector x-axis direction, we state that we effectively
        normalize in fractions of the width of the detector.
        
        The issue with terms like width and height is that these
        degenerate if the detector region-of-interest is square-shaped.
        This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but
        state how we would measure distances practically with a ruler and
        how we then measure positive distances.

      doc: |
        From which border of the EBSP (in the detector reference
        frame) is the pattern centre's y-position (PCy) measured?

  # distance_convention:
  # doc: |
  # How is the third of the three pattern centre parameter values,
  # the (distance) parameter DD, normalized. Which convention
  # is followed. We are aware that specifying one of the options here
  # also implicitly comes with conventions for some of the parameter
  # requested in this ELN. For now we would rather like to ask
  # the users though to be specific also to learn how such an ELN
  # will be used in practice.
