         Computational geometry description of a geodesic mesh.
         
         People from geodesic/surveyors will likely have specific demands and
         different views about what should be included in such a base class, given
         that nested geodesic meshes are a key component of climate modelling tools.
         For now we propose to use this base class as a container to organize metadata
         and data related to geodesic meshes.
         
         Specifically an instance of this base class should detail the rule set how
         how the geodesic (surface) mesh was instantiated as there are many
         possibilities. A geodesic surface mesh is in this sense a triangulated
         surface mesh with metadata. For additional details as an introduction
         into the topic see e.g.:

         Here, especially the section on subdivision schemes is relevant.
