  pulsed_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      In laser pulsing mode the values will be zero so the this field is recommended.
      However, for voltage pulsing mode it is highly recommended that users report the pulsed_voltage.

      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, n_ions]]
  standing_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Direct current voltage between the specimen and the
      (local electrode) in the case of local electrode atom
      probe (LEAP) instrument.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE

  laser_gun(NXsource):
    doc: |
      Atom probe microscopes use controlled laser, voltage,
      or a combination of pulsing strategies to trigger the
      excitation and eventual field evaporation/emission of
      an ion during an experiment.

    (NXtransformations):
      doc: |
        Affine transformations which describe the geometry how the
        laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system is
        defined, how it has to be transformed so that it aligns with
        the specimen coordinate system.
        A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space,
        should be assumed, whose positive z-axis points
        into the direction of the propagating laser beam.

  laser_beam(NXbeam):
    doc: |
      Details about specific positions along the focused laser beam
      which illuminates the (atom probe) specimen.

        Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
        measurement where the laser beam exits the 
        focusing optics.

      doc: |
        Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
        measurement where the laser hits the specimen.
