         Base class to detail a set of rotations, orientations, and disorientations.
         
         For getting a more detailed insight into the discussion of the
         parameterized description of orientations in materials science see:
         
         * `H.-J. Bunge &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/C2013-0-11769-2&gt;`_

         Once orientations are defined, one can continue to characterize the
         misorientation and specifically the disorientation. The misorientation describes
         the rotation that is required to register the lattices of two oriented objects
         (like crystal lattice) into a crystallographic equivalent orientation:

        <doc>
             Reference to an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` which contextualizes

    <field name="crystal_symmetry" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal.
             
             This has to be at least a single string. If crystal_symmetry is not
             provided, point group 1 is assumed.
             
             In the case that misorientation or disorientation fields are used
             and the two crystal sets resolve for phases with a different
             crystal symmetry, this field needs to encode two strings:
             The first string is for phase A. The second string is for phase B.
             An example of this most complex case is the description of the
             disorientation between crystals adjoining a hetero-phase boundary.

    <field name="sample_symmetry" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing
             the material/sample which could give rise to or may justify to use a
             simplified description of rotations, orientations, misorientations,
             and disorientations via numerical procedures that are known as
             symmetrization.
             
             If sample_symmetry is not provided, point group 1 is assumed.
             
             The traditionally used symmetrization operations within the texture
             community in Materials Science, though, have become obsolete thanks
             to improvements in methods, software, and available computing power.
            
             Therefore, users are encouraged to set the sample_symmetry to 1 (triclinic).

             In practice one often faces situations where indeed these assumed
             symmetries are anyway not fully observed, and thus an accepting of
             eventual inaccuracies just for the sake of reporting a simplified
             symmetrized description should be avoided.
