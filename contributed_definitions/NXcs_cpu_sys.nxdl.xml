         Computer science description of a system of classical central processing units.
         
         For coprocessor or graphic cards use :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys` instead.

             Granularizing at the socket level.
             
             Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single CPU one
             could describe using one instance of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_obj` inside one instance of
             :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
             A dual-socket server one could describe using two instances of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_obj`
             inside one instance of :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
             A server with two dual-socket server nodes one could describe
             with the above group of one :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys` into another :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
