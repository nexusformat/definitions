        The scan region is the area of phase space or sub-phase space where the scan is
        performed. The region could be N-dimensional and is defined by the minimum and
        maximum values of the scan axes.
    </doc>
    <field name="scan_offset_valueN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
            The offset of center of the scan region from the origin along the specific scan axis.
            
            'N' denotes the name of the specific scan axis. (Offset, start and end positions are related)
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="scan_rangeN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
            The range of the scan is the difference start and end values of the scan region
            along the dimension 'N'.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="scan_angleN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANGLE">
        <doc>
            The orientation of the scan region or subspace. Usually, the scan_offset and scan_range are enough
            to define the scan region. This field defines how the spatial space is oriented with respect to
            the frame of reference.
            
            Rename the field describing the angle with an axis of the spatial space (e.g. scan_angle_x).
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="scan_startN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
            The start of the scan is the starting point of the scan region (phase space or sub-phase space)
            for each independent scan axis.
            
            For N-dimensional, it is a list of N numbers.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="scan_endN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
            The end of the scan is the ending point of the scan region (phase space or sub-phase space)
            for each independent scan axis.
            
            Note: The scan_offset and scan_range are equivalent to the scan_start and scan_end.
            
            For N-dimensional, it is a list of N numbers.
