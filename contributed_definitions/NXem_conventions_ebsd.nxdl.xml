         Base class for method-specific conventions EBSD.
         
         This base class is expected to be used with :ref:`NXem_conventions`.
         
         This is the main issue which currently is not in all cases documented
         and thus limits the interoperability and value of collected EBSD data.
         Not communicating EBSD data with such contextual pieces of information
         and the use of file formats which do not store this information is the
         key unsolved problem.

                 details about coordinate system definitions. In this ELN users
                 have to possibility to fill in what they assume is sufficient to
                 define the coordinate system directions unambiguously.
                 Software which works with this user input needs to offer parsing
                 capabilities which detect conflicting input and warn accordingly.

                 In which direction are positive values for PCx measured from
                 the specified boundary. Keep in mind that the gnomonic space
                 is in virtually all cases embedded in the detector space.
                 Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is
                 embedded/laying inside the XdYd plane (of the detector
                 reference frame).
                 When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the
                 detector x-axis direction, we state that we effectively
                 normalize in fractions of the width of the detector.
                 
                 The issue with terms like width and height is that these
                 degenerate if the detector region-of-interest is square-shaped.
                 This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but
                 state how we would measure distances practically with a ruler and
                 how we then measure positive distances.

doc: |
How is the third of the three pattern centre parameter values,
the (distance) parameter DD, normalized. Which convention
is followed. We are aware that specifying one of the options here
also implicitly comes with conventions for some of the parameter
requested in this ELN. For now we would rather like to ask
the users though to be specific also to learn how such an ELN
will be used in practice.
