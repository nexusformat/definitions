             Definition of the logic what the filter yields:
             Whitelist specifies which entries with said value to include.
             Entries with all other values will be excluded.
             
             Blacklist specifies which entries with said value to exclude.

             Array of values to filter according to method. If the match e.g. specifies
             [1, 5, 6] and method is set to whitelist, only entries with values matching
             1, 5 or 6 will be processed. All other entries will be excluded.
