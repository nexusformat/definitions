                 respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
                 of this application definition rather than write details about the

                 If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
                 application definition should only be used for specifying when the
                 experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
                 - this start time field should be used.
                 
                 Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
                 both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
                 and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
                 even with having both time instances specified, it may not be possible
                 to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data 
                 were acquired.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
                 collected to compute this. These computations can take advantage of
                 individual time stamps in NXevent_em instances to provide
                 additional pieces of information.

                 Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
                 to create the file. Atom probe microscopy experiments are nowadays
                 in most cases controlled via commercial software. These are often
                 designed as integrated acquisition and instrument control software
                 solutions.
                 For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the
                 least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored
                 in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary and the
                 specifications of which are not publicly documented.
                 
                 Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected
                 to the instrument control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary
                 binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software
                 other than of AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite). In effect, RHIT and HITS files
                 store the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless
                 for users unless they have access to the commercial software.
                 
                 To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy with LEAP instruments 
                 delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
                 position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
                 analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
                 necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
                 the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
                 processing steps have to be stored.
                 
                 With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
                 (on the detector), calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
                 quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
                 ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.
                 
                 In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
                 via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
                 and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. In turn, these
                 labels decode elemental identities and can often also be used to
                 resolve isotopes. All these steps are in most cases performed using
                 commercial software.
                 
                 Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
                 (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
                 not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
                 for the early data acquisition and processing stages to obtain a useful
                 reconstructed and ranged dataset.
                 
                 Therefore, the application definition documents not only the measurement
                 but also the key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary
                 data into a tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.

                 For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/AP Suite
                 run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
                 Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments in Rouen, use the
                 identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.
                 
                 As a destructive microscopy method, a run can be performed only once.
                 It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
                 while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
                 needs to be distinguished with 
                 different run numbers. We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.

                     handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
                     the session starts.

                     hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
                     short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
                     better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

                 Specific details for application in atom probe microscopy follow.
                 In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
                 Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):
                 
                 * The laboratory space;  
                   a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
                   a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
                   transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
                   pushes into the instrument.  
                 * The specimen space;  
                   a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
                   whose z axis points towards the detector.  
                 * The detector space;  
                   a CS affixed whose xy plane is usually in the detector and whose  
                   z axis points towards the specimen.  
                 * The reconstruction space;  
                   a CS associated with the tomographic reconstruction.  
                   Its orientation depends on the commercial software used.  
                 * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
                   flight path of individual ions might be defined.  
                 
                 Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
                 Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.
                 
                 In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
                 space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
                 (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
                 within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
                 ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.
                 
                 For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
                 is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
                 the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
                 
                 The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
                 the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.

                 An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
                 scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:
                 
                 * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
                   (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
                   and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
                   microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
                   and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
                   Hence, there is no real probe/beam.

                     The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
                     single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) &lt;https://www.atomprobe.com&gt;`_.
                     Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
                     instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).
                     
                     By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
                     research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
                     the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
                     the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
                     the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
                     or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
                     Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
                     to control the instrument.
                     
                     Some of which are modularized and open,
                     some of which realize also integrated control units with
                     portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
                     (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.
                     
                     Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
                     community-specific API for getting finely granularized
                     access to such control settings.
                     
                     These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm

                     techniques which can measure the shape evolution:
                     
                     * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
                       but this usually takes an interrupted experiment

                       and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
                       Examples are `I. Mouton et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161&gt;`_ and `C. Fletcher &lt;https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6&gt;`_.
                     * Another, less accurate method, though, is to monitor

                     steps related to analog-to-digital conversion of detector signals
                     into ion hit positions. For AMETEK LEAP instruments this processing
                     takes place partly in the control unit of the detector partly
                     in the software. The process is controlled by the acquisition/
                     instrument control software (IVAS/APSuite/DAVis).
                     The exact details are not documented by AMETEK in an open manner.
                     For instruments built by individual research groups,
                     like the Oxcart instrument, individual timing data from the
                     delay-line detector are openly accessible.
