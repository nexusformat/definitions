                 If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
                 application definition should only be used for specifying when the

                 both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
                 and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
                 even with having both dates specified, it may not be possible
                 to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
                 were collected.

                 Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
                 to create the original results file of the atom probe experiment.
                 This file and program should not be confused with downstream
                 processing operations and file format conversion tasks.
                 
                 Atom probe microscopy experiments are except for still very much cases
                 controlled via commercial software. Such software is designed as an
                 integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
                 
                 For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the
                 least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored
                 in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary and the
                 specifications of which are not publicly documented.
                 
                 Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected
                 to the instrument control software and synced with the experiment
                 while signal is being detected. In effect, RHIT and HITS files
                 store the (rawest) experiment data in a closed manner that is
                 practically useless for users unless they have access to the
                 commercial software.
                 
                 To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy (APM) with LEAP instruments
                 delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
                 position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
                 analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
                 necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
                 the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
                 processing steps have to be stored.
                 
                 With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
                 (on the detector) and calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
                 quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
                 ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.
                 
                 In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
                 via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
                 and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. This is post-processing
                 even though in practice it is performed sometimes already (as preview)
                 already while data are still being collected.
                 
                 The ion types decode molecular identities which can very often be
                 mapped to elemental identities, and also to resolve isotopes.
                 All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software.
                 
                 Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
                 (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
                 not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
                 for the early stage data acquisition and processing stages to obtain
                 a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset.
                 
                 Therefore, this application definition documents not only the measurement
                 but also the key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary
                 data into a tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.
                 
                 Future guidance by the vendors could improve this description to cover
                 a substantial larger number of eventually metadata that so far
                 are not publicly documented and accessible in an open-source manner.

                 Neither the specimen_name nor the experiment_identifier but the identifier
                 through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
                 For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/APSuite
                 run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
                 Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the
                 identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.
                 
                 As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
                 It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
                 while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
                 needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
                 We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.
                 
                 This application definition does currently not allow to store the
                 entire set of such interrupted runs to be stored and covered. However,
                 this is not because of a technical limitation within NeXus but
                 because we have not seen a covering use case based on which we could
                 have implemented and conceptualized this. Atom probers are invited to
                 contact the respective people in the FAIRmat team to fix this.

                     not be used for an alias of the specimen. Instead, use short_title.
                     
                     In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
                     the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
                     by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
                     the characterization of a single specimen in a single continuous run.
                     
                     Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
                     sample history.

                 NXcoordinate_system_set base class. Specific details for application
                 in atom probe microscopy follow.
                 
                 In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
                 Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):
                 
                 * The laboratory space;  
                   a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
                   a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
                   transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
                   has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.  
                 * The specimen space;  
                   a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
                   whose z axis points towards the detector.  
                 * The detector space;  
                   a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the  
                   detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.  
                   This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion  
                   positions.  
                 * The reconstruction space;  
                   a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.  
                   The orientation depends on the analysis software used.  
                 * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
                   flight path of individual ions might be defined.  
                 
                 Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
                 Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.
                 
                 In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
                 space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
                 (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
                 within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
                 ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.
                 
                 For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
                 is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
                 the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
                 
                 The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
                 the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.

                 An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
                 scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:
                 
                 * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
                   (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
                   and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
                   microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
                   and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
                   Hence, there is no real probe/beam.  
                 * Second, the specimen is the lens of the microscope.

                     can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution
                     of the specimen can be stored. There are currently very few

                     * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
                       but this usually takes an interrupted experiment  
                       in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken,  
                       and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
                       Examples are `I. Mouton et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161&gt;`_  
                       and `C. Fletcher &lt;https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6&gt;`_.  
                     * Another method, which is less accurate though, is to monitor  
                       the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
                       (if available) in the instrument.  
                     * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
                       methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010&gt;`_.  
                     * A continuous monitoring of the specimen in a   
                       correlative electron microscopy/atom probe experiment  
                       is planned to be developed by `T. Kelly et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205&gt;`_

                     The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
                     single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) &lt;https://www.atomprobe.com&gt;`_.
                     Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
                     instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).
                     
                     By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
                     research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
                     the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
                     the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
                     the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
                     or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
                     Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
                     to control the instrument.
                     
                     Some of which are modularized and open,
                     some of which realize also integrated control units with
                     portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
                     (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.
                     
                     Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
                     community-specific API for getting finely granularized
                     access to such control settings.
                     
                     These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
                     application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.

                     (hit) multiplicity of an ion.
                     
                     Multiplicity must not be confused with how many atoms 
                     f the same element or isotope, respectively, a molecular
                     ion contains (which is instead encoded with the
                     isotope_vector field of each NXion instance).

                         The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction is
                         qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers

                         generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection
                         is to provide a container where model-specific parameters
                         and calibration models can be stored if users know these
                         for sure.
