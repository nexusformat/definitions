NEW ISSUE: possible offspring application definitions:
NXapm_opt/pl would be possible, as soon as NXluminescence by Carola Emminger and Florian Dobner is ready whereby
then there would be two subentries one for an NXapm and one for NXphotoluminesence to capture the photonic atom probe of Rouen/GPM
and finally if there were an NXapm_afm for atomic force microscopy the IMEC AFM/APT experiments could be stored with an NXapm_afm application definition
with NXapm and NXafm being respective subentries of the appdef but as NXapm_afm is a step-by-step approach one would have to release the constraint
that only a single measurement can be performed.
NXasat which could just take two subentries NXem and NXapm
NXasat should be a fuse of NXapm and NXem within an NXentry with NXsubentry, in this way we can combine the strength of both application definitions
to describe also the upcoming technique of atomic scale analytical tomography https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316677292-->

         Application definition for atom probe and field ion microscopy experiments.
         
         This application definition provides a place to document data and metadata to
         an atom probe experiment. Primarily the measurement itself is documented.
         However, as most atom probe experiments are controlled with commercial software
         which does not allow to access the raw detector hits, this application definition
         also includes two key groups of processing steps (reconstruction and ranging).
         
         During tomographic reconstruction measured data are processed into a point cloud
         of reconstructed positions of certain ions. During ranging time-of-flight data
         are identified as representing specific ions to annotate each ion with a label.
         
         Commercial software used in atom probe research is designed as an integrated
         acquisition and instrument control software. For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode
         atom probe (LEAP) instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results
         and metadata are stored in so-called STR, RRAW, RHIT, and HITS files, which
         are proprietary and their file format specifications not publicly documented.
         
         Supplementary metadata are kept in a database (formerly known as the ISDb)
         which is connected to the instrument control software and synced with the
         experiment while ions are detected. In effect, RHIT and HITS files
         store the (rawest) experiment data in a closed manner that is
         practically useless for users unless they have access to the
         commercial software.
         
         To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy (APM) with LEAP instruments
         delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
         position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
         analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
         necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
         the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
         processing steps have to be stored.
         
         With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
         (on the detector) and calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
         quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
         ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.
         
         In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
         via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
         and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. This is post-processing
         even though in practice it is performed sometimes already (as preview)
         already while data are still being collected.
         
         The ion types decode molecular identities which can very often be
         mapped to elemental identities, and also be used to distinguish isotopes.
         All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software.
         
         Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
         (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
         not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
         for the early stage of data acquisition and processing stages to obtain
         a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset.
         
         This application definition documents not only the measurement but also the
         key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary data into a
         tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.
         
         Future guidance by the technology partners like AMETEK/Cameca could improve
         this description to cover a substantial larger number of eventually metadata
         that so far are neither publicly documented nor accessible.

                 If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
                 application definition should only be used for specifying when the
                 experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
                 - this start_time field should be used.
                 
                 Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
                 both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
                 and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
                 even with having both dates specified, it may not be possible
                 to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
                 were collected.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be

                 For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/APSuite
                 run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
                 Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the
                 identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.
                 The field does not have to be required if the information is recoverable
                 in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case when RHIT or HITS
                 files are also stored alongside a data artifact instance which is
                 generated according to this NXapm application definition.
                 
                 As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
                 It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
                 while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
                 needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
                 We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.
                 
                 This application definition does currently not allow storing the
                 entire set of such interrupted runs. Not because of a technical limitation
                 within NeXus but because we have not seen a covering use case based
                 on which we could have designed and implemented this case. 
                 Atom probers are invited to contact the respective people in the
                 FAIRmat team to fix this.

                 Description of the sample from which the specimen was prepared or
                 site-specifically cut out using e.g. a focused-ion beam instrument.
                 
                 The sample group is currently a place for storing suggestions from
                 atom probers about other knowledge they have gained about the sample
                 from which they cut the specimen which is field-evaporated during the
                 experiment. Typically this is possible because the atom probe specimen
                 is usually not heat treated as is but one assumes that one has the sample
                 prepared as needed (i.e. with a specific grain diameter) and can thus
                 just cut out the specimen from that material.
                 
                 There are cases though where the specimen is processed further, i.e. the
                 specimen is machined further or exposed to external stimuli during the
                 experiment. In this case, these details should not be stored in the
                 sample group but atom probers should make suggestions how this application
                 definition can be improved to find a better place and compromise
                 how to improve this application definition.
                 
                 In the future also details like how the grain_diameter was characterized,
                 how the sample was prepared, how the material was heat-treated etc.,
                 should be stored as using specific application definitions/schemas
                 which are then arranged and documented with a description of the workflow
                 so that actionable graphs become instantiatable.

                     Qualitative information about the grain size, here specifically
                     described as the equivalent spherical diameter of an assumed
                     average grain size for the crystal ensemble.
                     Users of this information should be aware that although the grain
                     diameter or radius is often referred to as grain size and used in
                     e.g. Hall-Petch-type materials models this is if at all an ensemble
                     average whose reporting may be very informative or not if the specimen
                     contains a few grains only. In atom probe the latter is often the case
                     because grains are measured partially as their diameter can be in the
                     order of magnitude of the physical diameter of the specimen.
                     
                     Reporting a grain size is useful though as it allows judging if
                     specific features are expected to be found in the detector hit map.

                     Knowledge about this value can give an idea how the specimen
                     was heat treated, however there are many situations where one
                     can imagine that the scalar value for just the quenching rate,
                     i.e. the first derivative of the measured time-temperature profile
                     is itself time-dependant. An example is when the specimen was
                     left in the furnace after the furnace was switched off. In this case
                     the specimen cools down with a specific rate of how this furnace
                     cools down in the lab. Processes which in practice are often not
                     documented with measuring the time-temperature profile.
                     
                     This can be problematic because when the furnace door was left open
                     or the ambient temperature in the lab changes, i.e. for a series of
                     experiments where one is conducted on a hot summer
                     day and the next during winter as might have an effect on the
                     evolution of the microstructure. There are many cases where this
                     has been reported to be an issue in industry, e.g. think about aging
                     aluminium samples left on the factory parking lot on a hot summer
                     day.

                         normalization factorizes in the respective mass of the elements.
                         Python libraries like pint are challenged by these differences as

                     Descriptive name or ideally (globally) unique persistent identifier.
                     The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially the
                     predecessor/origin (see the sample group) from where this specimen was cut.
                     In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from the
                     sample referred to in the sample group or in cases of an instrument session
                     during which multiple specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive
                     enough to resolve which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken.
                     
                     The user is advised to store the details how a specimen was cut/prepared
                     from a specific sample in the sample_history. The sample_history field 
                     must not be used for writing an alias of the specimen. Instead,
                     use the field alias for this. As an example there may be a specimen/sample
                     monitoring system in a lab with bar codes. The bar code is a good
                     specimen/sample name. A shorter and more human readable alias like
                     A0 can be an example for something to write in the alias field.
                     
                     In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
                     the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
                     by this NXentry, because a single NXentry is to be used for the 
                     characterization of a single specimen in a single continuous run.
                     
                     Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
                     sample_history or if this is not possible in the sample group.

                     ideally as many details as possible of the material, its

                     handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
                     the session starts.

                     especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as

                 In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
                 Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):
                 
                 * World space;  
                   a CS specifying a local coordinate system of the planet earth which
                   identifies into which direction gravity is pointing such that
                   the laboratory space CS can be rotated into this world CS.
                 * The laboratory space;  
                   a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
                   a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
                   transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
                   has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.  
                   In summary, this CS is defined by the chassis of the instrument.
                 * The specimen space;  
                   a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
                   whose z axis points towards the detector.  
                 * The detector space;  
                   a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the  
                   detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.  
                   This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion  
                   positions.  
                 * The reconstruction space;  
                   a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.  
                   The orientation depends on the analysis software used.  
                 * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
                   flight path of individual ions might be defined.  
                 
                 Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
                 Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.
                 
                 In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
                 space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
                 (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
                 within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
                 ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.
                 
                 For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
                 is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
                 the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
                 
                 The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
                 the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.
                 Consult the work of A. J. Breen and B. Gault and team
                 for further details.

add a note about what is the tip space
Conventions: right-handed, Cartesian, 3D Euclidean CS should be used Laboratory space to be set by This is the space that is set by the chassis of the instrument. The Z direction must be reasonably parallel to gravity (+ve defined to be gravity vector pointing towards lowest ground), but can be defined to be a direction that is nominally parallel to gravity during an experiment. The origin must be placed within a bounding box of the chassis. Tip space instead of specimen space, The space occupied by a tip in the neutral position when ready for analysis. Z+ should be located in the direction of the needle (apex is Z+ from needle centreline). i) If the specimen moves relative to the laboratory frame, and the electrode does not, or if no electrode is present, then the space should be defined such that when the tip is moved physically, it also moves through tip space. ii) If the electrode moves relative to the laboratory frame, then the space should be defined such that, in tip space, the electrode position does not change.
iii) The transformation between laboratory space and Tip space must be describable by a fixed 3x3 transformation matrix. Detector space: This is a 2D space only, and contains X+ and Y+ directions. X+ and Y+ should indicate primary directions on the detector, and should be, for an equivalent straight-flight-path configuration, such that X+ and Y+ is matched to that of tip space. Laser space missing: Laser space: The coordinate frame describing the impinging wavefront on the sample. Z+ is the vector of the propagating wavefront. X+ is the orthogonal component of the tip direction within the tip-laser plane. The origin shall be placed at the best estimate for tip apex position at the start of the experiment. Reconstruction space : The space occupied by a correctly reconstructed dataset. X+ and Y+ should correspond to X+ and Y+ in the detector space. Z+ should be such that the needle centre line is normal to the detector position. The origin shall be placed at the tip apex.-->

                   (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
                   and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion

                     can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution
                     of the specimen can be stored. There are currently very few
                     techniques which can measure the shape evolution:
                     
                     * Correlative electron microscopy coupled with modeling  
                       but this usually takes an interrupted experiment  
                       in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken,  
                       and a new evaporation sequence initiated.  
                       Examples are `I. Mouton et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618016161&gt;`_  
                       and `C. Fletcher &lt;https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6&gt;`_.  
                     * Another method, which is less accurate though, is to monitor  
                       the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
                       (if available) in the instrument.  
                     * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
                       methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010&gt;`_.  
                     * A continuous monitoring of the specimen in a

                       is planned to be developed by `T. Kelly et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205&gt;`_

                     The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
                     single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) &lt;https://www.atomprobe.com&gt;`_.
                     Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
                     instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).
                     
                     By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
                     research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
                     the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
                     the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
                     the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
                     or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
                     Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
                     to control the instrument.
                     
                     Some of which are modularized and open,
                     some of which realize also integrated control units with
                     portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
                     (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.
                     
                     Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
                     community-specific API for getting finely granularized
                     access to such control settings.
                     
                     These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
                     application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.

                     Data post-processing step which is, like the impact position analyses,
                     usually executed in the integrated control software. This processing
                     yields how many ions were detected with each pulse.
                     
                     It is possible that multiple ions evaporate and hit the same or
                     different pixels of the detector on the same pulse.
                     These data form the basis to analyses of the so-called
                     (hit) multiplicity of an ion.
                     
                     Multiplicity must not be confused with how many atoms 
                     f the same element or isotope, respectively, a molecular
                     ion contains (which is instead encoded with the
                     isotope_vector field of each NXion instance).
