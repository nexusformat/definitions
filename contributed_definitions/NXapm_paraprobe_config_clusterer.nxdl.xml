                 This process maps results from cluster analyses performed with IVAS/APSuite
                 into an interoperable representation. Specifically in this process
                 paraprobe-clusterer takes results from clustering methods from other tools
                 of the APM community, like IVAS/APSuite. These results are usually reported
                 in two ways. Either as an explicit list of reconstructed ion positions.
                 In the case of IVAS these positions are reported through a text file
                 with a cluster label for each position.
                 
                 Alternatively, the list of positions is reported, as it is the case for
                 AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite) but the cluster labels are specified implicitly
                 only in the following way: The mass-to-charge-state ratio column of a
                 what is effectively a file formatted like POS is used to assign a hypothetical
                 mass-to-charge value which resolves a floating point representation
                 of the cluster ID.
                 
                 Another case can occur where all disjoint floating point values,
                 i.e. here cluster labels, are reported and then a dictionary is created
                 how each value matches to a cluster ID.
                 
                 In general the cluster ID zero is reserved for marking the dataset
                 as to not be assigned to any cluster. Therefore, indices of disjoint
                 clusters start at 1.

                         ions were investigated. The first three values encode the position
                         of the ion. The fourth value is an improper mass-to-charge-state-ratio
                         value which encodes the integer identifier of the cluster as a floating
                         point number.

                     How should iontypes be interpreted/considered during the cluster analysis.
                     Different options exist how iontypes are interpreted (if considered at all)
                     given an iontype represents in general a (molecular) ion with different isotopes
                     that have individually different multiplicity.
                     
                     The value resolve_all will set an ion active in the analysis
                     regardless of which iontype it is.
                     The value resolve_unknown will set an ion active when it is of the
                     UNKNOWNTYPE.
                     The value resolve_ion will set an ion active if it is of the
                     specific iontype, irregardless of its elemental or isotopic details.
                     The value resolve_element will set an ion active, and most importantly,
                     account as many times for it, as the (molecular) ion contains
                     atoms of elements in the whitelist ion_query_isotope_vector.
                     The value resolve_isotope will set an ion active, and most importantly,
                     account as many times for it, as the (molecular) ion contains isotopes
                     in the whitelist ion_query_isotope_vector.
                     
                     In effect, ion_query_isotope_vector acts as a whitelist to filter
                     which ions are considered as source ions of the correlation statistics
                     and how the multiplicity of each ion will be factorized.
                     
                     This is relevant as in atom probe we have the situation that a ion
                     of a molecular ion with more than one nuclid, say Ti O for example
                     is counted such that although there is a single TiO molecular ion
                     at a position that the cluster has two members. This multiplicity
                     affects the size of the feature and chemical composition.

                     For details about how the DBScan algorithms is the key behind the
                     specific modification known as the maximum-separation method in the
                     atom probe community consider `E. Jägle et al. &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1431927614013294&gt;`_

                         Strategy how runs are performed with different parameter:
                         
                         * For tuple as many runs are performed as parameter values.
                         * For combinatorics individual parameter arrays are looped over.
                         
                         As an example we may define eps with ten entries and min_pts with
                         three entries. If high_throughput_method is tuple the analysis is
                         invalid as we have an insufficient number of min_pts for the ten
                         eps values.
                         By contrast, for combinatorics paraprobe-clusterer will run three
                         individual min_pts runs for each eps value, resulting in a total
                         of 30 analyses.
                         As an example the DBScan analysis reported in `M. Kühbach et al. &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00486-1&gt;`_
                         would have defined an array of values np.linspace(0.2, 5.0, nums=241, endpoint=True)
                         eps values, min_pts one, and high_throughput_method set to combinatorics.
