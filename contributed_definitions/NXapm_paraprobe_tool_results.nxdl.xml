         Base class documenting the results obtained with a tool of the paraprobe-toolbox.
         
         The paraprobe-toolbox is a collection of open-source tools for performing
         efficient analyses of point cloud data where each point can represent atoms or
         (molecular) ions. A key application of the toolbox has been for research in the
         field of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and related Field Ion Microscopy (FIM):
         
         * `paraprobe-toolbox &lt;https://www.gitlab.com/paraprobe/paraprobe-toolbox&gt;`_
         * `M. KÃ¼hbach et al. &lt;https://paraprobe-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/main/&gt;`_
         
         The toolbox does not replace but complements existent software tools in this
         research field. Given its capabilities of handling points as objects with
         properties and enabling analyses of the spatial arrangement of and inter-
         sections between geometric primitives, the software can equally be used
         for analyzing data in Materials Science and Materials Engineering.
         
         The configuration and results of a run of a tool from the toolbox is documented
         using binary container formats. Currently, paraprobe-toolbox uses the
         Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5).

                 ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
                 information included when the analysis in this results file was started,
                 i.e. when the respective executable/tool was started as a process.

        </field>
        <field name="end_time" type="NX_DATE_TIME">
            <doc>
                 ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
                 information included when the analysis in this results file were
                 completed and the respective process of the tool exited.
            </doc>
        </field>
        <field name="status" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                 A statement whether the tool executable managed to process the analysis
                 or whether this failed. Status is written to the results file after the
                 end_time beyond which point in time the tool must no longer compute
                 any further analysis results but exit.
                 
                 Only when this status message is present and its value is `success`,
                 one should consider the results of the tool. In all other cases it might
                 b that the tool has terminated prematurely or another error occurred.

        <doc>
             Details about coordinate systems (reference frames) used. In atom probe several coordinate
             systems have to be distinguished. Names of instances of such :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
             should be documented explicitly and doing so by picking from the
             following controlled set of names:
             
             * paraprobe
             * lab
             * specimen
             * laser
             * instrument
             * detector
             * recon
             
             The aim of this convention is to support users with contextualizing which reference
             frame each instance (coordinate system) is. If needed, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations`
             are used to detail the explicit affine transformations whereby one can convert
             rpresentations between different reference frames.
             Inspect :ref:`NXtransformations` for further details.
