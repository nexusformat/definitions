         Circuit board with e.g. ADC and/or DAC electronic components.
         
         Currently used to store the settings of the so-called magboards used in
         Nion electron microscopes but likely this could be a useful base class for
         substantially more use cases where details at a deep technical instrument design
         level are relevant or important.
