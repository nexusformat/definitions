         Generating a tomographic reconstruction of the specimen uses selected and

         Very often scientists use own software scripts according to published procedures,
         so-called reconstruction protocols.

             Different reconstruction protocols exist. Although these approaches
             are qualitatively similar, each protocol uses different parameters
             (and interprets these differently). The source code to IVAS/APSuite
             is not open. For now users should store reconstruction parameter
             in this free-text field to guide how to parameterize this better in the
             future. For LEAP systems and reconstructions performed with IVAS/APSuite
             see `T. Blum et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119227250.ch18&gt;`_ (page 371).

             Different strategies for crystallographic calibration of the
             reconstruction are possible. Therefore, we collect first such
             feedback before parameterizing this further.
             
             If no crystallographic calibration was performed, the field
             should be filled with the n/a, meaning not applied.

                 using one nanometer cubic bins without applying position smoothening
                 algorithms during the histogram computation.
