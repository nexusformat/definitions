        <doc>
            Specification of the tomographic reconstruction to use for this analysis.
            
            Typically, reconstructions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated
            via files which store at least reconstructed ion positions and mass-to-charge-state-ratio
            values. Container files like HDF5 though can store multiple reconstructions.
            Therefore, the position and mass_to_charge concepts point to specific instances
            to use for this analysis.

    <group name="ranging" type="NXnote">
        <doc>
            Specification of the ranging definitions to use for this analysis.
            
            Ranging is the process of labeling time-of-flight data with so-called iontypes
            (aka ion species). Ideally, iontypes specify the most likely (molecular) ion
            that is assumed to have been evaporated given that its mass-to-charge-state ratio
            lies within the specific mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval of the iontype.
            
            The so-called unknown_type iontype represents the null model of an ion
            that has not been ranged (for whatever reasons) or is not rangeable.
            The identifier of this special iontype is always the reserved value 0.

            <doc>

        <doc>
            Specification of the triangulated surface mesh to use for this analysis.
            
            Such a surface mesh can be used to define the edge of the reconstructed
            volume to account for finite size effects.

    <group name="surface_distance" type="NXnote">
        <doc>
            Specification of the point-to-triangulated-surface-mesh distances to

        <field name="distance" type="NX_CHAR">

                points (ions).
