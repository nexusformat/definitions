         Base class to detail a set of rotations, orientations, and disorientations.
         
         For getting a more detailed insight into the discussion of the
         parameterized description of orientations in materials science see:
         
         * `H.-J. Bunge &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/C2013-0-11769-2&gt;`_
         * `T. B. Britton et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2016.04.008&gt;`_
         * `D. Rowenhorst et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1088/0965-0393/23/8/083501&gt;`_
         * `A. Morawiec &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-09156-2&gt;`_
         
         Once orientations are defined one can continue to characterize the
         misorientation and specifically the disorientation which describes the
         rotation that is required to register the lattices of two oriented objects
         (like crystal lattice) into a crystallographic equivalent orientation:
         
         * `R. Bonnet &lt;https://doi.org/10.1107/S0567739480000186&gt;`_
         
         Based on the idea of this NXorientation_set one could equally formulate
         an NXdisorientation_set.

    <field name="depends_on">
        <doc>

             how the here reported parameterized quantities can be interpreted.

    <!--2D rotations are a special type of 3D rotations and thus treated in 3D
just how to rotate the object into the reference frame defined by depends_on-->
    <field name="crystal_symmetry">
        <doc>
             Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal.
             This has to be at least a single string.
             In the case that misorientation or disorientation fields are used
             and the two crystal sets resolve for phases with a different
             crystal symmetry, this field has to encode two string.
             In this case the first string is for phase A the second one for phase B.
             An example of this most complex case is the description of the
             disorientation between crystals adjoining a hetero-phase boundary.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <!--how to encode the above (2,) string array or single string constraint-->
    <field name="sample_symmetry">
        <doc>
             Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing
             the material/sample which could give rise to or may justify to use a
             simplified description of rotations, orientations, misorientations,
             and disorientations via numerical procedures known as symmetrization.
             
             The traditionally used symmetrization operations within the texture
             community in Materials Science, though, are thanks to methodology and
             software improvements no longer strictly needed. Therefore, users are
             encouraged to set the sample_symmetry to 1 (triclinic) and thus assume
             there is no implied additional processing symmetry imprinted.
             
             In practice one often faces situations where indeed these assumed
             symmetries are anyway not fully observed and thus an accepting of
             eventual inaccuracies just for the sake of reporting a simplified
             symmetrized description can be avoided.

    <!--the benefit of such a representation is that with a known NXorientation_set base class one can implement a common parameterization transformation library (of which several already exist) in the microstructure modelling communities so that a program can read the information in the (NXorientation_set) instance and automatically transform/compute between different parameterizations. Super relevant for interoperability e.g. in SEM/EBSD, where this was a long standing issue and right now the most frequently accepted consensus is to report either Bunge-Euler angles or quaternions and then use existent transformation libraries (as implemented by e.g. Marc de Graeff for SEM/EBSD and used by many but not yet the majority of people in the computational materials modelling community within crystal plasticity, crystal growth modeling, DREAM.3D)-->
