         Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).
         
         Whenever possible, an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` should be used as
         a member in an :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` and the name of the instance
         should be this alias. This may support a process whereby jargon when talking
         about coordinate systems and conventions may become cleaner for users
         because it is not evident for people outside a lab that terms like e.g.
         tip space or specimen space refer to the same coordinate system.
         This is an example of jargon used in e.g. the field of atom
         probe tomography.

        <doc>
             Human-readable field telling where the origin of this CS is.
             Exemplar values could be *left corner of the lab bench*, *door-handle*
             *pinhole through which the electron beam exists the pole piece*.
             *barycenter of the triangle*, *center of mass of the stone*.
