                 Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlations (v_v) is the process of building logical
                 relations between objects, their proximity and eventual volumetric intersections.
                 Here, objects are assumed to be represented as a set of triangulated surface meshes.
                 
                 Volumetric overlap and proximity of volumetric features is identified for members of
                 sets of features to members of other sets of volumetric features. Specifically, for each time
                 step :math:`k` pairs of sets are compared:
                 Members of a so-called current_set to members of a so-called next_set.
                 Members can be different types of volumetric features.

            <field name="intersection_detection_method" type="NX_CHAR">
                <doc>
                     Specifies the method whereby to decide if two objects intersect volumetrically.
                     For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of `M. Kühbach et al. &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510&gt;`_,
                     it is assumed by default that two objects intersect if they share at least one ion with the same evaporation ID (shared_ion).
                     
                     Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections, the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to
                     tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra
                     to identify if two objects intersect or not. However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
                     cases which the tetrahedralization library used in the tests (TetGen) was not unable to tetrahedralize successfully.
                     These cases were virtually always associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra which had portions
                     of the mesh that were connected by almost point like tubes of triangles. 
                     
                     Finding more robust methods for computing intersections between not necessarily convex polyhedra might improve
                     the situation in the future. For practical reasons we have thus deactivated the functionality of tetrahedra-tetrahedron
                     intersections in paraprobe-intersector.
