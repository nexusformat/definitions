    <doc>
         Computational geometry description of the marching cubes algorithm.
         
         Documenting which specific version was used can help to understand how robust
         the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.
    </doc>
    <group name="grid" type="NXcg_grid">
        <doc>
             Reference/link to and/or details of the grid on which a specific
             marching cubes algorithm implementation is operating.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <field name="implementation">
        <doc>
             Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.
             
             See for example the following papers for details about how to identify a
             DOI which specifies the implementation used:
             
             * `W. E. Lorensen &lt;https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2020.2971284&gt;`_  
             * `T. S. Newman and H. Yi &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021&gt;`_  
             
             The value placed here should be a DOI. If there are no specific DOI or
             details write not_further_specified, or give at least a free-text
             description.

    <field name="program">
        <doc>
             Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used.
        </doc>
        <attribute name="version">
            <doc>
                 Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of
                 an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
                 and build instructions can be found so that the program can be
                 configured in such a manner that the result file is ideally
                 recreatable yielding the same results.

    <!--we could also think about storing the rule sets in here explicitly including the
coordinate system conventions; however, the problem is that many commercial
tools like Matlab do not expose the rule set.-->
