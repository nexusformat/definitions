<!--it is useful to define own base classes for frequently used classes
a polyhedron is a specific polytope in 3d, do we need
higher-dimensional polytopes? that could be useful for simplicies though
as they are used in numerics etc. maybe reach out here to our friends
from MarDI, for now let's assume we do not need polytopes for d > 3
NeXus already supports polyhedra via NXoff_geometry
the here proposed base class extends the capabilities to qualifiers of
polyhedra and also half_edge_data_structures that can be useful
for clean graph-based descriptions of polyhedra.-->

         Computational geometry description of a polyhedra in Euclidean space.
         
         Polyhedra, also so-called cells (especially in the convex of tessellations),
         here described have to be all non-degenerated, closed, built of and thus
         built out of not-self-intersecting polygon meshes. Polyhedra may make contact,
         so that this base class can be used for a future description of tessellations.
         
         For more complicated manifolds and especially for polyhedra with holes, users
         are advised to check if their particular needs are described by creating
         (eventually customized) instances of an NXcg_polygon_set, which can be
         extended for the description of piecewise-linear complexes.
