    <doc>
        An extension of positioner, used to maintain a measurement signal through
        a feedback loop, specialized for scanning probe microscopy applications.
        
        The component positions the spm head or cantilever tip on the surface of the sample
        thus maps 2D scan of the sample.

    <group name="z_controller" type="NXpid_controller">
        <doc>
            This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of tip (e.g., in topography scan in
            STM/STS experiment) in order to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set
            Point. Different control signals lead to different controller's behavior.
            
            The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
            
            p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller refers to K_p value from PID controller.
            i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller refers to K_i value from PID controller.
            setpoint from z_controller refers to setpoint from PID controller.
            
            Usually, the same controller, (z_controller) will be used for positioning the tip in three dimensional
            space. In this case, the controller coefficients (proportional, integral, differential) and other characteristic
            constants will be the same. Otherwise, for separate controllers positioning the tip in 3D space use the
            :ref:`feedback &lt;/NXspm_positioner/actuator/feedback-group&gt;` controller in actuator.
