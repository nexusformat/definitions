                 should only be used for specifying when the experiment was performed -
                 and the exact duration is not relevant - this start time field should
                 be used. Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with
                 specifying both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed
                 bookkeeping and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be
                 aware that even with having both time instances specified, it may not
                 be possible to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
                 were acquired. More detailed timing data over the course of the
                 experiment have to be collected to compute this.

                 Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used to
                 acquire/measure the dataset. Electron microscopy experiments are
                 usually controlled/performed via commercial integrated acquisition and
                 instrument control software. In many cases, an EM dataset is useful
                 only if gets post-processed already during the acquisition or shortly
                 thereafter, i.e. while the scientists is still sitting at the
                 microscope. Many of these processes are automated, if not they
                 virtually involve GUI interactions with the control software. Examples
                 include collecting of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of
                 these. These situations and tools are realized with individual
                 NXprocess groups which can hold more details and numerical data to
                 these processing steps. Frequently, some of these NXprocess groups are
                 performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is
                 strictly speaking not a single program used in electron microscopy,
                 and thus each NXprocess needs its own program, with version and

                         virtual point-like assumed source of the electron beam. A right-handed
                         coordinate system is assumed whose positive z-axis points in the
                         direction of the propagating electron beam. The translation actively
                         brings the coordinate system under depends_on into registration with a
                         coordinate system in the center of the lens.
