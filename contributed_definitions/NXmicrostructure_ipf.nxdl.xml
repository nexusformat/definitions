             Details about possible regridding and associated interpolation
             during the computation of the IPF map visualization can be stored
             using the input_grid, output_grid, and interpolation fields.
             
             The main purpose of this map is to offer a normalized default representation
             of the IPF map for consumption by a research data management system (RDMS).
             This is aligned with the first aim of :ref:`NXmicrostructure_ipf`, to bring colleagues
             and users of IPF maps together to discuss which pieces of information need storage.
             
             We are convinced a step-by-step design and community-driven discussion is a practical
             strategy to work towards an interoperable description and data model for exchanging
             IPF maps as a specific community-accepted method to convey orientation maps.
             
             With this design the individual RDMS solutions and tools can still continue
             to support specific custom data analyses workflow and routes but at least
             there is one common understanding which enables also those users who are
             not necessarily experts in all the details of the underlying techniques an
             understanding if the dataset is worth to become reused or repurposed.

             The color code which maps colors to orientation in the fundamental zone.
             
             For each stereographic standard triangle (SST), i.e. a rendering of the
             fundamental zone of the crystal-symmetry-reduced orientation space
             SO3, it is possible to define a color model which assigns a color to each
             point in the fundamental zone.
             
             Different mapping models are used. These implement (slightly) different
             scaling relations. Differences exist across representations of tech partners.
             
             Differences are which base colors of the RGB color model are placed in
             which extremal position of the SST and where the white point is located.
             
             For further details see:
             
             * [G. Nolze et al.](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576716012942)
             * [S. Patala et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2012.04.002).
             
             Details are implementation-specific and not standardized yet.
             
             Given that the SST has a complicated geometry, it can not yet be
             visualized using tools like H5Web, which is why for now the matrix
             of a rasterized image which is rendered by the backend tool gets
             copied into an RGB matrix to offer a default plot.
