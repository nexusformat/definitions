                Different types of AXISNAME dimensional scale axes are found in practice. A few examples:
                
                * No scaling, e.g. pixel position values like 0, 1, 2, 3 pixel.
                  Pixels on the map can be distinguished but that map is disconnected from
                  any sample surface context and eventually physical scaling
                * Scaling but no offset, e.g. calibrated pixel position 0., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 micron.
                  Pixels on the map can be compared for their distance to obtain e.g. size of features
                  but the position of the map relative to the e.g. the sample surface is unclear.
                  For IPF maps this is the most frequently reported situation.
                * Scaling and offset, which resolves also the absolute position of the map in
                  relation to the sample surface. This is useful information for stitching multiple
                  mappings together and other processing where precise and accurate
                  position data are relevant e.g. for correlative materials characterization.
                
                Three types of dimensional constraints for maps are possible:
                
                * (n_x, 3), a one-dimensional map,
                  typically used for coarse sampling and crystal size statistics.
                * (n_y, n_x, 3), a two-dimensional map,
                  the most frequently found reported
                * (n_z, n_y, n_x, 3), a three-dimensional map,
                  these are commonly generated using computational methods,
                  or in cases multiple EBSD maps have been stitched/reconstructed
                  into a three-dimensional map.

            The color code which maps color to orientation in the fundamental zone.
            
            For each stereographic standard triangle (SST), i.e. a rendering of the
            fundamental zone of the crystal-symmetry-reduced orientation space
            SO3, it is possible to define a color model which assigns a color to each
            point in the fundamental zone.
            
            Different mapping models are used. These implement (slightly) different
            scaling relations. Differences exist across representations of tech partners.
            
            Differences are which base colors of the RGB color model are placed in
            which extremal position of the SST and where the white point is located.
            
            For further details see:
            
            * [G. Nolze et al.](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576716012942)
            * [S. Patala et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2012.04.002).
            
            Details are implementation-specific and not standardized yet.

        <!--Given that the SST has a complicated geometry, it can not yet be
visualized using tools like H5Web, which is why for now the matrix
of a rasterized image which is rendered by the backend tool gets
copied into an RGB matrix to offer a default plot.-->
