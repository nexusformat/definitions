    <doc>
         Blue-print of a generic appdef for electron microscopy research formulated as a deep base class.
         
         This base class combines a method-specific and technical-design-level base class
         instance to provide a template for storing parameterized descriptions of
         pieces of information collected when performing electron microscopy research.
         
         The base class here shows all possible branches without making any statements
         as to which of these have to be used in an instance. Thereby, the base class
         provides a template how to name and structure concepts in a hierarchy
         to support finding information and reducing the need for renaming and
         restructuring information for a research field where many scientists perform
         very specific research but who all also share commonalities like usage of
         controlled electron beams, a focus on studies of electron beam matter interaction
         to explore physical mechanisms and phenomena, or the desire to characterize materials
         using electron microscopy.

                 An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
                 in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an
                 experiment (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment: 
                 *a test done in order to find out something, eg if an idea is correct*).
                 
                 The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory,
                 or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link

                 Free-text description about the experiment.
                 
                 Users are strongly advised to parameterize their description of the
                 experiment by using the respective base classes instead of writing prose
                 into this field.
                 
                 The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
                 The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn through
                 the information entered in this field in how far the current base
                 classes are incomplete.

                 ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
                 when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
                 codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
                 for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
                 duration is not relevant - this start_time field should be used.
                 
                 Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both
                 a start_time and an end_time because this enables software tools and
                 users to collect a more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
                 
                 The user should be aware that even with having both time instances specified,
                 it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or for how
                 long data were acquired.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
                 to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
                 advantage of individual time stamps start_time and end_time
