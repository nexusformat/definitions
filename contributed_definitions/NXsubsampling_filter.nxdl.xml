<definition xmlns="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" category="base" type="group" name="NXsubsampling_filter" extends="NXparameters" xsi:schemaLocation="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1 ../nxdl.xsd">
    <doc>
        Base class of a filter to sample members in a set based on their indices.
        
        The filter defines three parameters: The minimum, the increment, and the maximum
        index of values to include of a sequence :math:`[i_0, i_0 + 1, i_0 + 2, \ldots, i_0 + \mathcal{N}] with i_0 \in \mathcal{Z}`
        of indices. The increment controls which n-th index (value) to take.
        
        Take as an example a dataset with 100 indices (aka entries). Assume that the indices start at zero,
        i.e., index_offset is 0. Assume further that min, increment, max are set to 0, 1, and 99, respectively.
        In this case the filter will yield all indices. Setting min, increment, max to 0, 2, and 99, respectively
        will yield each second index value. Setting min, increment, max to 90, 3, and 99 respectively will yield
        each third index value beginning from index values 90 up to 99.
