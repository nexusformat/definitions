    <doc>
         Base class of a filter to sample members in a set based on their identifier.

    <field name="min_incr_max" type="NX_INT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
             Triplet of the minimum, the increment, and the maximum identifier to
             include of a sequence :math:`[i_0, i_0 + 1, i_0 + 2, \ldots, i_0 + \mathcal{N}] with i_0 \in \mathcal{Z}`
             of identifier. The increment controls which n-th identifier (value) to take.
             
             Take as an example a dataset with 100 identifier (aka entries). Assume that
             the identifier start at zero, i.e. identifier_offset is 0). Assume further
             that min_incr_max is set to [0, 1, 99]. In this case the filter will
             yield all identifier. Setting min_incr_max to [0, 2, 99] will take each
             second identifier. Setting min_incr_max to [90, 3, 99] will take each
             third identifier beginning from identifier 90 up to 99.
