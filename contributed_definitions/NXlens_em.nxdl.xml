         Description of an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.
         
         For NXtransformations the origin of the coordinate system is placed
         in the center of the lens
         (its polepiece, pinhole, or another point of reference).
         The origin should be specified in the NXtransformations.
         
         For details of electro-magnetic lenses in the literature see e.g. `L. Reimer &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-38967-5&gt;`_

    <field name="value" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
             This field should be used when the exact voltage or current of the lens is not directly controllable
             as the control software of the microscope does not enable users/or is was not configured to enable
             the user to retrieve these values. In this case this field should be used to specify the value as
             read from the control software. Although consumers of the application definition should not expect
             this value to represent the exact physical voltage or excitation, it is still useful to know though
             as it allows other users to reuse this lens setting, which, provided a properly working instrument
             and software should bring the lenses into a similar state.

    <field name="depends_on">
        <doc>
             Specifies the position of the lens by pointing to the last transformation in the

             Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
             each other and only one component should relate to the reference
             coordinate system.
