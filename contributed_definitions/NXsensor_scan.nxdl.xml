                     All the setting values of the independently scanned controllers are listed under corresponding
                     NXsensor groups. Similarly, seperate NXsensor groups are used to store the readings from each
                     measurement sensor.
                     
                     For example, in a temperature-dependent IV measurement, the temperature and voltage must be 
                     present as independently scanned controllers and the current sensor must also be present with
                     its readings.

                             For each point in the scan space, either the nominal setpoint of an independently scanned controller
                             or a representative average value of a measurement sensor is registered.
                             
                             The length of each sensor's data value array stored in this group should be equal to the number of scan points
                             probed in this scan. For every scan point [N], the corresponding sensor value can be picked from index [N].
                             This allows the scan to be made in any order as the user describes above in the experiment. We get matching
                             values simply using the index of the scan point.
