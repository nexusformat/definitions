         Computer science description of pseudo-random number generator.
         
         The purpose of such metadata is to identify if exactly the same sequence
         can be reproduced, like for a PRNG or not (for a true physically random source).

             Different approaches for generating random numbers with a computer exists.
             Some use a dedicated physical device where the state is unpredictable (physically).
             Some use a mangling of the system clock (system_clock), where also without
             additional pieces of information the sequence is not reproducible.
             Some use so-called pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) are used.
             These are algorithms which yield a deterministic sequence of practically
             randomly appearing numbers. These algorithms different in their quality in
             how close the resulting sequences are random.
             Nowadays one of the most commonly used algorithm is
             the MersenneTwister (mt19937).

             users should set the value to zero.

one could also think about making reference to the NIST PRNG test suite to qualify the PRNG-->
