<!--key points to keep in mind when thinking about a general enough description for coarse-graining systems of atoms into
so-called microstructural features of interest for which we may store also thermodynamic properties or other feature-specific descriptors
  several viewpoints how to coarse-grain are equally justified: grains are useful when there are crystallites with adjoining interfaces and #   none, or only some statistical populations of defects and/or some spatially-well defined defects inside these
  however, if grains are build almost only from defects like dislocation walls, it might no longer be useful to define the grains
  as a well identifiable region whose majority volume shows long-range atomic periodicity (so that defining an orientation makes) sense.
  one could then rather describe the set of defects. Alternatively one could describe a material volume by sampling individual so-called
  material points (e.g. in continuum-scale plasticity models) or describe the material volume really from the atoms up
  but there are many terms used in materials engineering which people may want to distinguish which stand however between the scales e.g.
  lattice curvature, this is jargon with some truth in it but curvature has to be build from atoms and defects need to build the curvature
  dislocations are another good example where different research questions demand differently granularized descriptions e.g.
  average density, total line length, per character, per family, line length, curvature, jog, kink density,
  coarse-grainable structural motifs in the dislocation core, atomic structure
  also different scales one would like to distinguish as this is relevant when defects couple/show spatiotemporal correlations
  to specific mechanisms (e.g. phonons) or when defect affect the properties of other defects
  ambiguous choices: is the grain boundary part of the grain or is it an own defect?
  i.e. can/should we store grains as childs of their grain boundary set vs the interface the childs of the grains?
  Depending on the use case we need to have a flexible description which can address a continuum of descriptors:
  important is that one can logically map different features
  Length scale of homogeneity: With the reality of a multi-parameter space of all possible methods and effects and
  different external stimuli applied for real materials, simulations in computational materials science typically focus
  their analysis on a few individual, spatiotemporally constrained effects and boundary conditions for which the simulation
  is formulated, useful, interpretable, and comparable to experiment.
  Data structures for multi-scale materials modeling IMM/ICME are currently diverse because they reflect the above-mentioned needs
  and different views which researchers have on their simulations e.g. DFT (time, length-scale, which electronic effects)
  RVE annealing phenomena at the micrometer scale (pressure, temperature, length scale, interactions considered or not)
  Some regions are well separated spatially (although it can be non-trivial to quantify the distance in a multi-dim parameter space)
  Some simulations are cross-scale (classical MD at the cutting edge with micrometer crystal plasticity microsecond and/or annealing at
  ns time scale) MD with classical vs abinitio-informed potential for studying evolution of mechanisms and phenomena at different length scales-->

                 The term microstructure is used to describe the spatial arrangement of
                 crystal defects inside a sample/specimen without demanding necessarily
                 that this structure is mainly at the micron length scale.
                 Nanostructure and macrostructure are close synonyms.
                 Material architecture is a narrow synonym.
                 
                 Given that microstructure simulations nowadays more and more consider
                 the atomic arrangement, this application definition can also be used
                 to describe features at the scale of atoms.

                         Summary quantities which are the result of some post-processing of
                         the snapshot data (averaging, integrating, interpolating).
                         Frequently used descriptors from continuum mechanics and thermodynamics
                         can be used here. A few examples are given. Each descriptor is currently
                         modelled as an instance of an NXprocess because it is relevant to
                         understand how the descriptors are computed.

                             Conceptually distinguished object/feature in the ROI/
                             system with some relevance. Instances of NXms_feature_set can
                             be nested to build a hierarchy of logically-related objects.
                             
                             A typical example for MD simulations is to have one
                             ms_feature_set for the atoms which is the parent to another
                             ms_feature_set for monomers/molecules/proteins which is then the
                             parent to another ms_feature_set for the secondary, another feature_set
                             for the tertiary, and the parent for another feature_set for the
                             quaternary structure.
                             
                             Another typical example from materials engineering is to have
                             one ms_feature_set for crystals (grains/phases) which serves as
                             the parent to another ms_feature_set for interfaces between these
                             crystals which then is the parent for another ms_feature_set to
                             describe the triple junctions which is then the parent for the
                             quadruple/higher-order junctions between which connect the
                             triple lines.
                             
                             Another example from discrete dislocation dynamics could be to
                             have one ms_feature_set for the dislocations (maybe separate
                             sets for each dislocation type or family) which are then
                             parents to other ms_feature_set which describe junctions between
                             dislocations or features along the dislocation line network.
