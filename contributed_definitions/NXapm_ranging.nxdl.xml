         Base class for the configuration and results of ranging definitions.
         
         Ranging is a data post-processing step used in the research field of
         atom probe during which elemental, isotopic, and/or molecular identities
         are assigned to mass-to-charge-state-ratios within a certain interval.
         The documentation of these steps is based on ideas that
         have been described in the literature:

        <doc>
             How many ion types are distinguished. If no ranging was performed, each
             ion is of the special unknown type. The iontype ID of this unknown type
             is 0 representing a reserve value. Consequently,
             iontypes start counting from 1.

                 To begin with we use a free-text field to learn how

                 of NXapm_ranging can then use this information to parameterize
                 these models.
