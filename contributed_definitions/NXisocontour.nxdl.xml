         Base class for describing isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.
         
         Iso-contouring algorithms such as Marching Cubes and others are frequently
         used to segment d-dimensional regions at crossings of a threshold value,
         the so-called isovalue.
         
         In Computational Materials Science phase-field methods are frequently used.
         Phase-field variables are discretized frequently using regular grids.
         
         Isocontour algorithms are often used in such context to pinpoint the
         locations of microstructural features from this implicit phase-field-
         variable-value-based description.
         
         One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
         for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed-matter physicists,
         and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field (and other)
         simulation data can take advantage of NeXus base class to improve
         interoperability.
