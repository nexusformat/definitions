         Computational geometry description of isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.
         
         Iso-contouring algorithms such as MarchingCubes and others are frequently
         used to segment d-dimensional regions into regions where intensities are
         lower or higher than a threshold value, the so-called isovalue.
         
         Frequently in computational materials science phase-field methods are
         used which generate data on discretized grids. Isocontour algorithms
         are often used in such context to pinpoint the locations of microstructural
         features from this implicit phase-field-variable-based description.
         
         One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
         for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed matter physicists,
         and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field simulation
         data could be described with NeXus, provided base classes such as the this one
         get further extend according to the liking of the phase-field community.
