        Base class for describing isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.
        
        Iso-contouring algorithms such as Marching Cubes and others are frequently
        used to segment d-dimensional regions at crossings of a threshold value,
        the so-called isovalue.
        
        In Computational Materials Science phase-field methods are frequently used.
        Phase-field variables are discretized frequently using regular grids.
        
        Isocontour algorithms are often used in such context to pinpoint the
        locations of microstructural features from this implicit phase-field-
        variable-value-based description.
        
        One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
        for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed-matter physicists,
        and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field (and other)
        simulation data can take advantage of NeXus base class to improve
        interoperability.
