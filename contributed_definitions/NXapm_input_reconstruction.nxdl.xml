         Metadata of a dataset (tomographic reconstruction) in atom probe microscopy.
    </doc>
    <field name="filename">
        <doc>
             Name of the (NeXus)/HDF5 file which stores reconstructed ion position
             and mass-to-charge-state ratios. Such an HDF5 file can store multiple
             reconstructions. Using the information within the dataset_name fields
             is the mechanism whereby paraprobe decides which reconstruction to
             process. With this design it is possible that the same HDF5
             file can store multiple versions of a reconstruction.
        </doc>
        <attribute name="version">
            <doc>
                 Version identifier of the file (representing an at least SHA256 strong)
                 hash. Such hashes serve reproducibility as they can be used for tracking
                 provenance metadata in a workflow.
            </doc>
        </attribute>
    </field>
    <field name="dataset_name_reconstruction">
        <doc>
             Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
             specific reconstructed ion positions to use for this analysis.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="dataset_name_mass_to_charge">
        <doc>
             Name of the dataset inside the HDF5 file which refers to the
             specific mass-to-charge-state-ratio values to use for this analysis.
