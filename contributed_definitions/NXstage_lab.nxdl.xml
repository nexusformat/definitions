         A stage lab can be used to hold, align, orient, and prepare a specimen.
         
         Modern stages are multi-functional devices. Many of which offer a controlled
         environment around (a part) of the specimen. Stages enable experimentalists
         to apply stimuli. A stage_lab is a multi-purpose/-functional tools which
         can have multiple actuators, sensors, and other components.
         
         With such stages comes the need for storing various (meta)data 
         that are generated while manipulating the sample.
         
         Modern stages realize a hierarchy of components: For example the specimen
         might be mounted on a multi-axial tilt rotation holder. This holder is 
         fixed in the support unit which connects the holder to the rest of the
         microscope.
         
         In other examples, taken from atom probe microscopy, researchers may work
         with wire samples which are clipped into a larger fixing unit for
         convenience and enable for a more careful specimen handling.
         This fixture unit is known in atom probe jargon as a stub.
         Stubs in turn are positioned onto pucks.
         Pucks are then loaded onto carousels.
         A carousel is a carrier unit with which eventually entire sets of specimens
         can be moved in between parts of the microscope.
         
         An NXstage_lab instance reflects this hierarchical design. The stage is the 
         root of the hierarchy. A stage carries the holder.
         In the case that it is not practical to distinguish these two layers,
         the holder should be given preference.
         
         Some examples for stage_labs in applications:
         
         * A nanoparticle on a copper grid. The copper grid is the holder.  
           The grid itself is fixed to the stage.  
         * An atom probe specimen fixed in a stub. In this case the stub can be  
           considered the holder, while the cryostat temperature control unit is  
           a component of the stage.  
         * Samples with arrays of specimens, like a microtip on a microtip array  
           is an example of a three-layer hierarchy commonly employed for  
           efficient sequential processing of atom probe experiments.  
         * With one entry of an application definition only one microtip should be  
           described. Therefore, the microtip is the specimen,  
           the array is the holder and the remaining mounting unit  
           that is attached to the cryo-controller is the stage.  
         * For in-situ experiments with e.g. chips with read-out electronics  
           as actuators, the chips are again placed in a larger unit.  
         * Other examples are (quasi) in-situ experiments where experimentalists  
           anneal or deform the specimen via e.g. in-situ tensile testing machines  
           which are mounted on the specimen holder.  
         
         To cover for an as flexible design of complex stages, users should nest
         multiple instances of NXstage_lab objects according to their needs to reflect
         the differences between what they consider as the holder and what 
         they consider is the stage.
         
         Instances should be named with integers starting from 1 as the top level unit.
         In the microtip example stage_lab_1 for the stage, stage_lab_2 for the holder
         (microtip array), stage_lab_3 for the microtip specimen, respectively. 
         The depends_on keyword should be used with relative or absolute naming inside
         the file to specify how different stage_lab instances build a hierarchy
         if this is not obvious from numbered identifiers like the stage_lab_1 to 
         stage_lab 3 example. The lower it is the number the higher it is the
         rank in the hierarchy.

NEW ISSUE: on the specimen such as NXmech_testing_unit and NXfurnace, NXreaction_cell
NEW ISSUE: by contrast, the purpose and design of so-called nano/or micromanipulators,
i.e. automatable devices to perform e.g. site-specific lift out, procedures warrants
to define an own class NXspecimen_manipulator given this is nothing else than
miniature robot arm essential one could also think about creating an own NXrobotarm class,
below are two examples of such tools as they are used in FIB and SEMs-->
