         Base class for collecting a session with a real electron microscope.
         
         For collecting data and experiments which are simulations of an
         electron microscope use the :ref:`NXem_sim` base class.

    <group name="em_lab" type="NXinstrument">
        <doc>
             (Meta)data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.
             
             This em_lab group differs from potential em_lab groups inside
             :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances in that here the more static descriptions
             are kept while changing, i.e. time-dependent pieces of information are
             logged, via the em_lab group inside the desired number of instances
             of NXevent_data_em.
             
             While using an :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instance, users should store only those
             settings about a component which are relevant to understand the current
             state of the component. Here, current means for the time interval which
             the event covers (as it is detailed via start_time and end_time) timestamps.
             
             For example it is not relevant to store in each :ref:`NXevent_data_em`
             electron_source group again the details of the gun type and the manufacturer
             but only the high-voltage value and that only if it is different from the value
             that is specified in the em_lab section for the static settings.
             
             In effect, this defines an information inference hierarchy which starts
             in an individual :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instance followed by a probing of the
             static section.

                 Description of the type of the detector.
                 
                 Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
                 Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator,
                 direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.
