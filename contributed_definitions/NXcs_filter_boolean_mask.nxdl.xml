         Computer science base class for packing and unpacking booleans.
         
         One use case is processing of object sets (like point cloud data).
         When one applies e.g. a spatial filter to a set of points to define which 
         points are analyzed and which not, it is useful to document which points were
         taken. One can store this information in a compact manner with an array of 
         boolean values. If the value is True the point is taken, else it is not.
         
         If the points are identified by an array of integer identifiers and an 
         arbitrary spatial filtering, the boolean array will be filled with True and False
         values in an arbitrary manner. Especially when the number of points is large,
         for instance several thousands and more, some situations can be more efficiently
         stored if one would not store the boolean array but just list the identifiers
         of the points taken. For instance if within a set of 1000 points only one point is
         taken, it would take (naively) 4000 bits to store the array but only 32 bits
         to store e.g. the ID of that taken point. Of course the 4000 bit field is so 
         sparse that it could be compressed resulting also in a substantial reduction 
         of the storage demands. Therefore boolean masks are useful compact descriptions
         to store information about set memberships in a compact manner. 
         In general it is true, though, that which representation is best, i.e. 
         most compact (especially when compressed) depends strongly on occupation of
         the array.
         
         This base class just bookkeeps metadata to inform software about necessary 
         modulo operations to decode the set membership of each object. This is useful
         because the number of objects not necessarily is an integer multiple of the bit depth.

             identifier and so on and so forth.
