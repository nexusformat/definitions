         Metadata and settings of an electron microscope for scans and images.
         
         The need for such a structuring of data is evident from the fact that
         electron microscopes are dynamic. Oftentimes it suffices to calibrate the 
         instrument at the start of the session. Subsequently, data
         (images, spectra, etc.) can be collected. Users may wish to take only
         a single scan or image and complete their microscope session; however
         
         frequently users spend much longer at the microscope, recalibrate,
         and take multiple data items (scans, images, spectra) each coming
         with own detector and on-the-fly processing settings and calibration.
         
         For the single data item use case one may argue that the need for additional
         grouping is redundant. Instead, the metadata could equally be stored inside
         the respective groups of the top-level mandatory NXinstrument group.
         On the flip side, even for a session with a single image it would also not
         harm to nest the data.
         
         In fact, oftentimes scientists feel that there is a need to store details 
         about eventual drift of the specimen in its holder (if such data is available)
         or record changes to the lens excitations caused or apertures used.
         Although current microscopes are usually equipped with stabilization
         systems for many of the individual components, it can still be useful
         to store time-dependent data in detail.
         
         Another reason if not a need for more finely granularizable options for
         storing time-dependent data, is that over the course of a session one may
         reconfigure the microscope. What is a reconfiguration? This could be the
         change of an aperture mode because a scientist may first collect an image
         with some aperture and then choose a different one. As the aperture affects
         the electron beam it will affect the system.
         
         Let aside for a moment the technology and business models, an EM could be
         monitored (and will likely become so more in the future) for streaming out
         spatio-temporal details about its components, locations of objects
         and eventually applied stimuli and positioning of the specimen.
         
         Some snapshot or integrated data from this stream are relevant for
         understanding signal genesis and electron/ion beam paths. In such a generic
         case it might be necessary to sync these streaming data with those intervals
         in time when specific measurements are taken (spectra collected,
         images taken, diffraction images indexed on-the-fly).
         
         Theoretically, an instrument and specimen should be considered as dynamic.
         Scientists often report or feel (difficult to quantify) observations that
         microscopes *perform differently* across sessions, without sometimes being
         able to identify clear root causes. Users of the instrument may consider
         such conditions impractical and thus either abort their session or try to
         bring the microscope first into a state where conditions are considered
         stable and of high enough quality for collecting data.
         
         In all these cases it is practical to store time-dependent data of the
         instrument state not in the respective instrument component groups
         of the top-level NXinstrument but in a sort of a log of event data.
         This is the idea behind the NXevent_data_em snapshot containers.
         
         The base class requires a start time and an optional end time.
         The end time should be added to represent a time interval
         (remind the idea of the instrument state stream) during which the
         scientist considered the microscope (especially ebeam and specimen)
         as stable enough.
         
         For specific simulation purposes, mainly in an effort to digitally repeat
         or simulate the experiment, it is tempting to consider dynamics of the
         instrument, implemented as time-dependent functional descriptions of
         e.g. lens excitations, beam shape functions, trajectories of groups of
         electrons, or detector noise models.
         
         For now the preferred strategy to handle these cases is through
         customizations of the specific fields within NXevent_data_em instances.
         
         Another alternative could be to sample finer, eventually dissimilarly along
         the time axis; however this may cause situations where an NXevent_data_em
         instance does not contain specific measurements
         (i.e. images, spectra of scientific relevance).
         
         In this case one should better go for a customized application definition
         with a functional property description inside members (fields or groups)
         in NXevent_data_em instances or resort to a specific application definition
         which documents metadata for tracking explicitly electrons
         (with ray-tracing based descriptors/computational geometry descriptors)
         or tracking of wave bundles.
         
         This perspective on more subtle time-dependent considerations of electron
         microscopy can be advantageous also for storing details of time-dependent
         additional components that are coupled to and/or synced with instrument.
         
         Examples include cutting-edge experiments where the electron beam gets
         coupled/excited by e.g. lasers. In this case, the laser unit should be
         registered under the top-level NXinstrument section. Its spatio-temporal
         details could be stored inside respective groups of the NXinstrument.

             If the user wishes to specify an interval of time that the snapshot should represent during which the
             instrument was stable and configured using specific settings and calibrations, the start_time is the 
             start (left bound of the time interval) while the end_time specifies the end (right bound) of the time interval.
