         Metadata and settings of an electron microscope for scans and images.
         
         The need for such a structuring of data is evident from the fact that
         electron microscopes are dynamic. Oftentimes it suffices to calibrate the
         instrument at the start of the session. Subsequently, data (images, spectra, etc.)
         can be collected. Users may wish to take only a single scan or image and
         complete their microscope session; however
         
         frequently users are much longer at the microscope, recalibrate and take
         multiple data items (scans, images, spectra). Each item comes with own detector
         and on-the-fly processing settings and calibrations.
         
         For the single data item use case one may argue that the need for an additional
         grouping is redundant. Instead, the metadata could equally be stored inside
         the respective groups of the top-level mandatory NXinstrument group.
         On the flip side, even for a session with a single image, it would also not
         harm to nest the data.
         
         In fact, oftentimes scientists feel that there is a need to store details
         about eventual drift of the specimen in its holder (if such data is available)
         or record changes to the lens excitations caused or apertures used.
         Although current microscopes are usually equipped with stabilization
         systems for many of the individual components, it can still be useful
         to store time-dependent data in detail.
         
         Another reason if not a need for having more finely granularizable options for
         storing time-dependent data, is that over the course of a session one may
         reconfigure the microscope. What is a reconfiguration? This could be the
         change of an aperture mode because a scientist may first collect an image
         with some aperture and then choose a different value. As the aperture affects
         the electron beam it will affect the system.
         
         Let aside for a moment the technology and business models, an EM could be
         monitored (and will likely become so more in the future) for streaming out
         spatio-temporal details about its components, locations of objects,
         and eventually (externally) applied stimuli and positioning of the specimen.
         
         Some snapshot or integrated data from this stream are relevant for understanding
         signal genesis and electron/ion-beam-sample interaction (paths). In such a generic
         case it might be necessary to sync these streaming data with those intervals
         in time when specific measurements are taken (spectra collected,
         images taken, diffraction images indexed on-the-fly).
         
         Theoretically, an instrument and specimen should be considered as dynamic.
         Scientists often report or feel (difficult to quantify) observations that
         microscopes *perform differently* across sessions, without sometimes being
         able to identify clear root causes. Users of the instrument may consider
         such conditions impractical, or *too poor* and thus either abort their session
         or try to bring the microscope first into a state where conditions are considered
         stable and of high enough quality to reuse data collection.
         
         In all these cases it is practical to store time-dependent data of the
         instrument state not in the respective instrument component groups
         of the top-level NXinstrument but in a sort of a log of event data.
         This is the idea behind the NXevent_data_em snapshot containers.
         
         Ideally, NXevent_data_em are equipped with a start_time and end_time
         to represent a time interval (remind the idea of the instrument state stream)
         during which the scientist considered (or practically has to consider)
         the microscope (especially ebeam and specimen) as stable enough.
         
         Arguably it is oftentimes tricky to specify a clear time interval when the
         microscope is stable enough. Take for instance the acquisition of an image
         or spectra stack. It is not fully possible (technically) to avoid that even
         within a single image instabilities of the beam are faced and drift occurs.
         But does this warrant to document the microscope state at an even finer
         and impractical in-between one collects signal time intervals?
         
         This is a question of how finely does one granularize pieces of information.
         A possible solution is to consider each probed position, i.e. point in time
         when the beam was not blanked and illuminates a portion of the material, i.e.
         the interaction volume, whose signal contributions are then counted by the
         detector(s) as per pixel- or per voxel signal in the region-of-interest.
         In principle this application definition allows for such doing so.
         However, in most cases such a fine granularization would demand the collection
         of data which are as of now hardly retrievable with commercial instruments
         nor of primary interest.
         
         A frequently made choice, mainly for convenience, is that drift and scan distortions
         are considered a feature or inaccuracy of the image and/or spectrum and thus
         one de facto accepts that the microscope was not as stable as expected during
         the acquisition of the image. We learn that the idea of a time interval
         during the microscope session may be interpreted differently by different
         users. Here we consider the choice to focus on images and spectra, and eventually
         single position measurements as the smallest granularization level.
         Which eventually may require to add optional NXprocess instances for respectively
         collected data to describe the relevant distortions. Nevertheless, the distortions
         are typically corrected for by numerical protocols. Which warrant an own 
         consideration in the future. A more detailed overview of such computational
         steps to cope with scan distortions is available in the literature:

         For specific simulation purposes, mainly in an effort to digitally repeat
         or simulate the experiment, it is tempting to consider dynamics of the
         instrument, implemented as time-dependent functional descriptions of
         e.g. lens excitations, beam shape functions, trajectories of groups of
         electrons, or detector noise models.
         
         For now the preferred strategy to handle these cases is through
         customizations of the specific fields within NXevent_data_em instances.
         
         Another alternative could be to sample finer, eventually dissimilarly along
         the time axis; however this may cause situations where an NXevent_data_em
         instance does not contain specific measurements
         (i.e. images, spectra of scientific relevance).
         
         In this case one should better go for a customized application definition
         with a functional property description inside members (fields or groups)
         in NXevent_data_em instances; or resort to a specific offspring application
         definition of NXem which documents metadata for tracking explicitly electrons
         (with ray-tracing based descriptors/computational geometry descriptors)
         or tracking of wave bundles.
         
         This perspective on much more subtle time-dependent considerations of electron
         microscopy can be advantageous also for storing details of time-dependent
         additional components that are coupled to and/or synced with a microscope.
         
         Examples include cutting-edge experiments where the electron beam gets
         coupled/excited by e.g. lasers. In this case, the laser unit should be
         registered under the top-level NXinstrument section. Its spatio-temporal
         details could be stored inside respective groups of the NXinstrument though
         inside instances of here detailed NXevent_data_em.
