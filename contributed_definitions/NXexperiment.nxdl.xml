      Describe the contents of an NXentry resulting from a data collection using multiple detectors,
      generating raw and derived data, potentially being scanned across multiple dimensions.
      
      It is not uncommon for a beamline at a synchrotron to collect data from multiple detectors in during a single scan. NeXus files
      from these scans will contain many :ref:`NXdata` either containing direct links to :ref:`NXdetector` data, or data derived from
      this data. The aim of the :ref:`NXexperiment` class is to store NeXus classes in a way that better represents the *experiment* performed,
      rather than the *instrument* the experiment was performed on.
      
      For example, a small-angle scattering beamline with a detector for SAXS,
      WAXS, XRF, a diode for transmitted intensity and an XY stage performs a single grid scan: The XRF raw data
      might be have multiple channels that are summed to give the MCA, then small regions of this sum may also
      be summed to produce simple elemental maps.
      
      This file contains multiple plottable datasets, therefore multiple NXdata groups and NXdetectors, 
      but with no obvious way to discern what was measured and how the plottable datasets are related.
      
      The :ref:`NXexperimentdata` class allows (multiple) :ref:`NXdata` to be related to each other (through the ``DATANAME_origin`` attribute in :ref:`NXexperimentdata`), and back to the :ref:`NXdetector`
      used to collect the data.
      
      (**required**) :ref:`NXexperimentdata` container for :ref:`NXdata` and single :ref:`NXdetector` used for the measurement
