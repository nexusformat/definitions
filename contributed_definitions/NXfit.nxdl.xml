                 As an example, in X-ray spectroscopy could depend on the energy scale

                 The relative area can simply be derived by dividing the total_area by the
                 total area of all peaks or by a more complicated method (e.g., by
                 additionally dividing by the relative sensitivity factors). Details shall

                 Oftentimes, if the peaks and fit backgrounds are defined independently (i.e, with their own
                 parameter sets), the resulting global fit is a function of the form
                 :math:`model = peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3).`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the
                 set of parameters for one peak/background.

        <field name="description">
            <doc>
                 Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
                 Examples:
                 - least squares
                 - non-linear least squares
                 - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)
                 - linear regression
                 - Bayesian linear regression
            </doc>
        </field>
        <field name="formula">
            <doc>
                 For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the `global_fit_function` given above.
                 As an example, for a linear least squared algorithm on independent components, the formula of the error_function
                 would be :math:`LLS(peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3))`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the set
                 of parameters for one peak/background.
                 
                 It is however also possible to supply more involved formulas (e.g., in the case of constrained fits).

             fits the measured observations.
             
             This value (which is a single number) is oftenused to guide adjustments to the
             fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.

                 Metric used to determine the goodness of fit. Examples include:
