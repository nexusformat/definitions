                             Weighting factor, in atom probe, often termed multiplicity.
                             The weighting factor is the multiplier with which the integrated
                             intensity contribution from the point/ion gets multiplied.
                             The delocalization computes the integrated intensity for each
                             grid cell. Effectively, this is an explicitly evaluated kernel
                             method where each specific position of an ion is replaced by a
                             smoothing kernel. For atom probe weights are positive and integer
                             specifically the multiplicity of the ion, in accordance with the
                             respective rulesets as defined by weighting_model.

                                         and vertices as this supports a more efficient storage of the geometry data.
                                         It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively in which
                                         case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
                                         Naively here means that one for example stores each vertex of a triangle
                                         mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
                                         the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.

                                         six sides can be distinguished, each making an own boundary.

                             An iso-surface is the boundary between two regions across which
                             the magnitude of a scalar field falls below/exceeds a threshold
                             magnitude phi.
                             For applications in atom probe microscopy the location and shape
                             of such a boundary (set) is typically approximated by
                             discretization.
                             This yields a complex of not necessarily connected geometric
                             primitives. Paraprobe-nanochem approximates this complex with
                             a soup of triangles.

                                         Users are encouraged to reduce the vertices to unique set of positions
                                         and vertices as this supports a more efficient storage of the geometry data.
                                         It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively in which
                                         case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
                                         Naively here means that one for example stores each vertex of a triangle
                                         mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
                                         the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.

                                         followed by the second vertex of the first face, until the last vertex
                                         of the first face. Thereafter, the start vertex of the second face, the

                                             The projection variable here describes the cosine of the
                                             angle between the gradient direction and the normal
                                             direction vector.
                                             This is a descriptor of how parallel the projection is
                                             that is especially useful to document those triangles
                                             for whose projection is almost perpendicular.

                                     Iso-surfaces of arbitrary scalar three-dimensional fields
                                     can show a complicated topology. Paraprobe-nanochem can run
                                     a DBScan-like clustering algorithm which performs a
                                     connectivity analysis on the triangle soup. This yields a
                                     set of connected features with their surfaces discretized
                                     by triangles. Currently, the tool distinguishes at most
                                     three types of features:
                                     
                                     1. So-called objects, i.e. necessarily watertight features
                                        represented polyhedra.
                                     2. So-called proxies, i.e. features that were replaced by a
                                        proxy mesh and made watertight.
                                     3. Remaining triangle surface meshes of arbitrary shape and
                                        cardinality.
                                     
                                     These features can be interpreted as microstructural features.
                                     Some of them may be precipitates, some of them may be poles,
                                     some of them may be segments of dislocation lines or other
                                     crystal defects which are decorated (or not) with solutes.

                         The multiplicity whereby the ion position is accounted for
                         irrespective whether the ion is considered as a decorator
                         of the interface or not.
                         As an example, with atom probe it is typically not possible
                         to resolve the positions of the atoms which arrive at the detector
                         as molecular ions. Therefore, an exemplar molecular ion of two carbon
                         atoms can be considered to have a multiplicity of two to account that
                         this molecular ion contributes two carbon atoms at the reconstructed
                         location considering that the spatial resolution of atom probe
                         experiments is limited.

                         The ROIs are defined as cylinders for the computations.
                         To visualize these though we discretize them into regular n-gons.

                         so that they are rendered smoothly in visualization software.
