        This describes a fit function that is used to fit data to any functional form.
        
        A fit function is used to describe a set of data :math:`y_k, k = 1 ... M`,  which are collected as a function
        of one or more independent variables :math:`x` at the points :math:`x_k`. The fit function :math:`f` describes
        these data in an approximative way as :math:`y_k \approx f(a_0, . . . a_n, x_k)`,
        where :math:`a_i, i = 0 . . . n` are the *fit parameters* (which are stored the instances of ``NXfit_parameter``).
    </doc>
    <field name="description">
        <doc>
            Human-readable description of this fit function.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="formula">
        <doc>
            Mathematical formula of the function, taking into account the instances of ``NXfit_parameter``.
            
            This should be a python parsable function. Here we should provide which keywords are available
            and a BNF of valid grammar.
