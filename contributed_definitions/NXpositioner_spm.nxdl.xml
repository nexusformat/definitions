         Extending positioner from NXpositioner to maintain a measurement signal through
         a feedback loop, specialized for scanning probe microscopy applications.

    <group name="z_controller" type="NXpid">
        <doc>
             This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of the STM/STS tip in order
             to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set Point. Different control
             signals lead to different controller's behavior.
             
             The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
             
             p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller is the same as K_p_value from PID controller.
             i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller is the same as K_i_value from PID controller.
             setpoint from z_controller is the same as setpoint from PID controller.

    <field name="z_offset" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Offset added to the initial averaged position tip on Z-axis before starting to
             scan.

    <field name="tip_position_z" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Indicate the tip position Z. The tip position can also be varied when the controller is not running.
             This is the final position after the tip reaches an equilibrium state.

    <field name="controller_name" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Controller name. This name which will be displayed at places where you can select a
