         Base class to describe specific analysis methods in electron microscopy.
         
         This base class represent a template how specialized, deep, and method-specific
         base classes can be defined with which an (NXem) application
         definition gets equipped with specific groups to document method-specific
         processing steps and report analyzed quantities.
         
         The template base class name :ref:`NXem_method` needs to be changed for each
         method e.g. :ref:`NXem_adf`, :ref:`NXem_ebsd`, :ref:`NXem_eels`, :ref:`NXem_eds`.
