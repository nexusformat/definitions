    <!--further comments from Thilo Remmele (Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung)
ThermoFisher uses CEOS correctors but makes customizations to these in their microscopes
Aberration naming schema: C_order_multiplicity (similar to NXem, but with
another coordinate system and in addition with a confidence entry.
Aberrations with multiplicity 0 have no angle entry (C1,C3,C5,.., CEOS notation)
contrast transferfuntion: ctf = e^(-i*Xi(g)) in Fourier space
aberration function:
Xi(g) = 2*pi/lamda{ 1/2 * (lamda*g)^2 (C20 + C22 cos[2(phi-phi_22)]
+1/3 * (lamda*g)^3 (C31 cos[(phi-phi_31) + C33 cos[3(phi-phi_33)
+1/4 * (lamda*g)^4 (C40 + C42 cos[2(phi-phi_42)] + C44 cos[4(phi-phi_42)]
+1/f * (lamda*g)^f Sum (Cfm cos[m(phi-phi_fm)] where m=[0,2,..f] for even f and m=[1,3,..,f] for odd f-->
    <!--Thilo Remmele also mentions that there is a mapping of aberration coefficient names:
C_2_0 -> C1 Defocus
C_2_2 -> A1 2-fold astigmatism
C_3_3 -> A2 3-fold astigmatism
C_3_1 -> B2 axial coma
C_4_0 -> C3 spherical aberration
C_4_4 -> A3 4-fold astigmatism
C_4_2 -> S3 star aberration
C_5_5 -> A4 5-fold astigmatism-->
    <!--C_5_1 -> B4 axial coma
C_5_3 -> D4 three lobe aberration
C_6_0 -> C5 spherical aberration
C_6_2 -> S5 star aberration
C_6_4 -> R5 rosette aberration
C_6_6 -> A5 6-fold astigmatism-->
    <!--In a session with HRTEM images the corrector is commonly aligned.
The final measurement with the estimated residual aberrations
should be saved in a corrector.html file (an example is appended
at the end of this file. Unfortunately the datetime is not included
in that html output, nor is the used outer tilt angle and exposure time.
The datetime may be estimated from the file datetime and the Delta t entry,
but caution if that datetime is not preserved on file transfers!
More than one detector entry could occure but is not common.
A seperate corrector schema, so it can be easily exchanged to other correctors if necessary.
It might be useful to collect all the corrector entries in one table, for example to analyse the performance of the corrector.
The corrector entry of the nexus em definition lacks the confidence information and the
parameter settings for the estimation oft the aberrations.-->
