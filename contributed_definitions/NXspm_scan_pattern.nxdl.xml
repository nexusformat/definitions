    <doc>
        Basic base class to define the pattern of a scan in a given scan region.
        
        The base class is intended to handle the following scan types or patterns:
        
        Trajectory: A list of N-dimensional sequential vectors, representing a point in phase space, describes
          the trajectory line for a full scan.
        Mesh: For each dimension, a range and a direction are chosen. When a scan along a dimension is done, a
          single step in the next dimension is taken, and then the scan in the previous dimension is repeated.
          As such we can speak about the fastest and the slowest scan axes.
          
        Snake: Similar to a mesh scan but the current scanning direction reversed after each line completed.
        Spiral: A scan taken along a spiral trajectory.
        Tilt: At each step, a proportional movement is done in all dimensions (an special case of Trajectory scan).
        Linear: A scan where the scanning will be performed along a single independent axis.

    <field name="scan_speedN" type="NX_NUMBER" nameType="partial" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
            Define the scan speed in the forward direction along the axis (except the spiral and trajectory scans),
            if forward and backward speeds below are not specified.
            
            If the scan goes in the negative direction, the speed should be negative.
            
            Rename the field, according to the name of the dimension (e.g. scan_speed_x, scan_speed_voltage).
            
            Trajectory scan: N refers to the nth trajectory line (line between two trajectory points).

            in steps.
