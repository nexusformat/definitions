         Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms in Euclidean space.
         
         The parallelograms do not have to be connected, can have different size,
         can intersect, and be rotated.
         This class can also be used to describe rectangles or squares, axis-aligned or not.
         The class represents different access and description levels to offer both
         applied scientists and computational geometry experts to use the same
         base class but rather their specific view on the data:
         
         * Most simple many experimentalists wish to communicate dimensions/the size
           of e.g. a region of interest in the 2D plane. In this case the alignment
           with axes is not relevant as eventually relevant is only the area of the ROI.
         * In other cases the extent of the parallelogram is relevant though.
         * Finally in CAD models we would like to specify the polygon
           which is parallelogram represents.
         
         Parallelograms are important geometrical primitives. Not so much because of their
         uses in nowadays, thanks to improvements in computing power, not so frequently
         any longer performed 2D simulation. Many scanning experiments probe though
         parallelogram-shaped ROIs on the surface of samples.
         
         Parallelograms have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of polygons
         which are not self-intersecting.
         
         The term parallelogram will be used throughout this base class but includes
         the especially in engineering and more commonly used special cases,
         rectangle, square, 2D box, axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), or
         optimal bounding box (OBB) but here the analogous 2D cases.
         
         An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in computational science
         and codes to represent a rectangle whose edges are aligned with the axes 
         of a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees these are important data
         objects for time- as well as space-efficient queries
         of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.
         
         An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best
         tight fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
         rotated. Other than in 3D dimensions the rotation calipher method offers
         a rigorous approach to compute optimal bounding boxes in 2D.
