                 Number of ions spatially filtered from results of the hit_finding algorithm
                 :ref:`NXapm_hit_finding` from which an instance of a reconstructed volume
                 has been generated. These ions get new identifier assigned in the process -
                 the so-called evaporation_identifier, which must not be confused with
                 the pulse_identifier!

         Base class for the configuration and results from a voltage-and-bowl ToF correction algorithm.
         
         The voltage-and-bowl correction is a ata post-processing step to correct for ion impact position
         flight path differences, detector biases, and nonlinearities.

NEW ISSUE: realistic is that currently scientists can pull always a calibrated time-of-flight
but not necessarily unprocessed timing data from the detector (unless individuals built the instrument).
Relevant for ranging are the calibrated data, thats why only these
(as an intermediate/compromise solution) are required in this version of the application definition
