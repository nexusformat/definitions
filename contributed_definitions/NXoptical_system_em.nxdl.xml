    <field name="rotation" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_ANGLE">
        <doc>
            In the process of passing through an :ref:`NXlens_em` electrons are typically accelerated
            on a helical path about the optical axis. This causes an image rotation whose strength
            is affected by the magnification.
            
            Microscopes may be equipped with compensation methods (implemented in hardware
            or software) that reduce but not necessarily eliminate this rotation.
            
            See  `L. Reimer &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-38967-5&gt;`_ for details.
