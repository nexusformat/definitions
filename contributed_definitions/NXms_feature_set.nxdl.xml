TJLD: clearly there are two possibilities: either concatenate or make one NXms_feature_set for each molecule or component in the topology hierarchy

    <!--the design of this base class makes it possible to have Joseph's suggestion
but it has the additional benefit that as it defines the set one also
bundle the description for all features at this hierarchy level into combined
arrays to make the eventual storage of this for instances with millions of features
more efficient as in the current design each molecule would again be a group
and having millions of groups comes with e.g. HDF5 with substantial overlap
I faced this when storing grains from micro-scale continuum crystal growth simulations
TJLD: is_molecule(NX_BOOLEAN): not used, could however be added in an appdef which uses instances of NXms_feature_set
TJLD: the key point we can use NXms_feature_set in the same way as currently TJLD use atoms and atoms/atom_groups/molecule0, */molecule1, ...
but with the additional benefit of a much richer geometrical description and the details about the uncertainty of these descriptions
I can also imagine that materials engineers e.g. can reuse NXms_feature_set in an application definition by just then naming
their group e.g. grains(NXms_feature_set) and use in the application definition either only the (material point), interface network, or volumetric description-->
