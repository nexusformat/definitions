             Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
             snapshots. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
             interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

    <!--should we rather name snapshots explicitly always snapshot_1, snapshot_2

if we give the names of the snapshots free via making them all capital
how can we assure that snapshots are numbered consecutively?
