             Description of how the Process Value for the PID controller is produced by sensor(s) in the setup.
             
             For example, a set of sensors could be averaged over before feeding it back into the loop.

             The sensor representing the Process Value used in the feedback loop for the PID.
             
             In case multiple sensors were used, this NXsensor should contain the proper calculated/aggregated value.

             Proportional term. The proportional term produces an output value
             that is proportional to the current error value.
             The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error
             by a constant Kp, called the proportional gain constant.

    </field>
    <field name="K_i_value" type="NX_NUMBER">
        <doc>
             The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both
             the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error.
             The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous
             error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have
             been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then
             multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the
             controller output.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="K_d_value" type="NX_NUMBER">
        <doc>
             The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining
             the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of
             change by the derivative gain K_d. The magnitude of the
             contribution of the derivative term to the overall control
             action is termed the derivative gain, K_d
