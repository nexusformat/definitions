    <doc>
         A base class for bias spectroscopy to describe the change in the physical properties
         of the sample with respect to the sweep voltage applied on a sample of STM/AFM/... experiment.
         
         In these experiments an electric potential is applied between the (conductive) sample and the probe
         (tip), and the physical properties (e.g. tunnelling current) is measured as the function of this
         potential. The potential is varied in so-called voltage sweeps and the corresponding properties are
         recorded accordingly.

        <doc>
             The measurement of the I(V) curve can come in two ways:
             1. Constant spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end with a constant
             spacing between the tip and surface.
             2. Variable spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end in a discretized
             spacing between the tip and surface. (Either an array of voltages, or the steps are defined).

             These components position the probe relative to the sample, thus help obtaining maps of the data
             across the sample surface.

                 This combines not only how the voltages are changed, but how the voltage values are
                 correlated to a position across the sample surface, measuring sweeps are each spatial
                 coordinate or mapping the response at constant voltage, etc.
                 For STS experiment, the scan type is usually a single-point scan (trajectory scan).
