    <doc>
        A base class for bias spectroscopy to describe the change in the physical properties
        of the sample with respect to the sweep voltage applied on a sample of STM/AFM/... experiment.
        
        In these experiments an electric potential is applied between the (conductive) sample and the probe
        (tip), and the physical properties (e.g. tunnelling current) is measured as the function of this
        potential. The potential is varied in so-called voltage sweeps and the corresponding properties are
        recorded accordingly.

        <doc>
            The measurement of the I(V) curve can come in two ways:
            1. Constant spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end with a constant
            spacing between the tip and surface.
            2. Variable spacing: The bias voltage is swept from the start to the end in a discretized
            spacing between the tip and surface. (Either an array of voltages, or the steps are defined).
