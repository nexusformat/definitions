        <doc>
             Wall-clock time how long the event took. This may be in principle
             end_time minus start_time; however usage of eventually more precise timers
             may warrant to use a finer temporal discretization,
             and thus demand a more precise record of the wall-clock time.
             Elapsed time may contain time portions where resources were idling.
