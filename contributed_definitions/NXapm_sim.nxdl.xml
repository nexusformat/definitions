noteworthy the situation is similar to electron microscopy especially TEM where factually
interpretation without simulations is pointless. The only difference is that in EM there
is a large availability of documentation and open-source tools for performing such simulations.-->

         Base class for simulating ion extraction from matter via laser and/or voltage pulsing.
         
         Ideally, we would like to describe the workflow of experiments and simulations of
         atom probe and field-evaporation simulation research in more detail and contextualize
         better descriptions of experiments and computer simulations.
         The strategy to achieve this is detailed in the introducing docstring of
         :ref:`NXapm_msr`. This :ref:`NXapm_sim` base class is envisioned as the
         twin of the :ref:`NXapm_msr` base class.
