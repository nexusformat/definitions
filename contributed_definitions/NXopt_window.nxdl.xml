A draft of a new base class to describe a window in a optical setup or device-->
<definition xmlns="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" category="base" type="group" name="NXopt_window" extends="NXaperture" xsi:schemaLocation="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1 ../nxdl.xsd">

         A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.
         
         This first verion originates from NXopt to describe cryostate windows
         and possible influences for ellipsometry measurements.
         
         For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
         etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
         direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
         window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
         windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
         use a second 'WINDOW(NXaperture)' field.
         
         The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
         measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
         a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
         in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
         performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference data should be
         considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
         should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.
         
         The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
         beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
         defined by the 'depends_on' field.

                     corrected, i.e. either mathematically or by performing a
                     reference measurement. In the latter case, provide the link to
                     to the reference data in 'reference_data_link'.

                     Link to the NeXus file which describes the reference data if a
                     reference measurement for window correction was performed.
                     Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on a reference
                     sample and on the same sample, and using the same conditions as
                     for the actual measurement with and without windows. It should
                     have been conducted as close in time to the actual measurement
                     as possible.
