        Base class documenting the configuration used for a tool of the paraprobe-toolbox.
        
        The paraprobe-toolbox is a collection of open-source software tools for performing
        efficient analyses of point cloud data where each point can represent atoms or
        (molecular) ions. A key application of the toolbox has been for research in the
        field of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and related Field Ion Microscopy (FIM):
        
        * `paraprobe-toolbox &lt;https://www.gitlab.com/paraprobe/paraprobe-toolbox&gt;`_
        * `M. KÃ¼hbach et al. &lt;https://paraprobe-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/main/&gt;`_
        
        The toolbox does not replace but complements existent software tools in this
        research field. Given its capabilities of handling points as objects with
        properties and enabling analyses of the spatial arrangement of and inter-
        sections between geometric primitives, the software can equally be used
        for analyzing data in Materials Science and Materials Engineering.
         
        The configuration and results of a run of a tool from the toolbox is documented
        using binary container formats. Currently, paraprobe-toolbox uses the
        Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5).

    <group name="reconstruction" type="NXnote">
        <doc>
            Specification of the tomographic reconstruction to use for this analysis.
            
            Typically, reconstructions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated
            via files which store at least reconstructed ion positions and mass-to-charge-state-ratio
            values. Container files like HDF5 though can store multiple reconstructions.
            Therefore, the position and mass_to_charge concepts point to specific instances
            to use for this analysis.

        <field name="position" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                Name of the node which resolves the reconstructed ion position
                values to use for this analysis.

        </field>
        <field name="mass_to_charge" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                Name of the node which resolves the mass-to-charge-state-ratio
                values to use for this analysis.

    <group name="ranging" type="NXnote">
        <doc>
            Specification of the ranging definitions to use for this analysis.
            
            Ranging is the process of labeling time-of-flight data with so-called iontypes
            (aka ion species). Ideally, iontypes specify the most likely (molecular) ion
            that is assumed to have been evaporated given that its mass-to-charge-state ratio
            lies within the specific mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval of the iontype.
            
            The so-called UNKNOWNTYPE iontype represents the null model of an ion
            that has not been ranged (for whatever reasons).
            The identifier of this special iontype is always the reserved value 0.

        <field name="ranging_definitions" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                Name of the (parent) node directly below which (in the hierarchy)
                the ranging definition for (molecular) ions are stored.

        <doc>
            Specification of the triangulated surface mesh to use for this analysis.
            
            Such a surface mesh can be used to define the edge of the reconstructed
            volume to account for finite size effects.

            Specification of the point-to-triangulated-surface-mesh distances to

        <field name="distance" type="NX_CHAR">
