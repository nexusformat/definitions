         Computational geometry description of a set of polygons in Euclidean space.
         
         Polygons are related are specialized polylines:
         
         * A polygon is a geometric primitive that is bounded by a closed polyline
         * All vertices of this polyline lay in the d-1 dimensional plane.
           whereas vertices of a polyline do not necessarily lay on a plane.
         * A polygon has at least three vertices.
         
         Each polygon is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
         The members of a set of polygons may have a different number of vertices.
         Sometimes a collection/set of polygons is referred to as a soup of polygons.
         
         As three-dimensional objects, a set of polygons can be used to define the
         hull of what is effectively a polyhedron; however users are advised to use
         the specific NXcg_polyhedron_set base class if they wish to describe closed
         polyhedra. Even more general complexes can be thought, for instance
         piecewise-linear complexes, as these can have holes though, polyhedra without
         holes are one subclass of such complexes, users should rather design an own
         base class e.g. NXcg_polytope_set to describe such even more
         complex primitives.

        <doc>
             Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
             polygons. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
             interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

             Usually, the winding_order field is required to interpret the value.
