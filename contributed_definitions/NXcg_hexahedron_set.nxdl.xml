<!--it is useful to define own base classes for frequently used classes
a polyhedron is a specific polytope in 3d, do we need
higher-dimensional polytopes? that could be useful for simplicies though
as they are used in numerics etc. maybe reach out here to our friends
from MarDI, for now let's assume we do not need polytopes for d > 3-->

         Computational geometry description of a set of hexahedra in Euclidean space.
         
         The hexahedra do not have to be connected, can have different size,
         can intersect, and be rotated.
         This class can also be used to describe cuboids or cubes, axis-aligned or not.
         The class represents different access and description levels to offer both
         applied scientists and computational geometry experts to use the same
         base class but rather their specific view on the data:
         
         * Most simple many experimentalists wish to communicate dimensions/the size
           of specimens. In this case the alignment with axes is not relevant as
           eventually the only relevant information to convey is the volume of the 
           specimen.
         * In many cases, take for instance an experiment where a specimen was taken
           from a specifically deformed piece of material, e.g. cold-rolled,
           channel-die deformed, the orientation of the specimen edges with the
           experiment coordinate system can be of very high relevance.
           Examples include to know which specimen edge is parallel to the rolling,
           the transverse, or the normal direction.
         * Sufficient to pinpoint the sample and laboratory/experiment coordinate
           system, the above-mentioned descriptions are not detailed enough though
           to create a CAD model of the specimen.
         * Therefore, groups and fields for an additional, computational-geometry-
           based view of the hexahedra is offered which serve different computational
           tasks: storage-oriented simple views or detailed topological/graph-based
           descriptions.
         
         Hexahedra are important geometrical primitives, which are among the most
         frequently used elements in finite element meshing/modeling.
         
         Hexahedra have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of polygons
         which are not self-intersecting.
         
         The term hexahedra will be used throughout this base class but includes
         the especially in engineering and more commonly used special cases,
         cuboid, cube, box, axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), optimal bounding
         box (OBB).
         
         An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in
         computational science and codes to represent a cuboid whose edges
         are aligned with a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees these
         are important data objects for time as well as space efficient queries
         of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.
         
         An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best
         tight fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
         rotated. Exact and substantially faster in practice approximate algorithms
         exist for computing optimal or near optimal bounding boxes for point sets.
