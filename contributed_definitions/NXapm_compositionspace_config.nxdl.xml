        This is an application definition for the common NFDI-MatWerk/FAIRmat infrastructure
        use case IUC09 that explores how to improve the organization and results storage of the
        CompositionSpace tool by using the NeXus data model and semantics.

                Specification of the tomographic reconstruction used for this analysis.
                Typically, reconstructions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated via
                files which store at least reconstructed ion positions and mass-to-charge-state-ratio
                values. Container files like HDF5 though can store multiple reconstructions.
                Therefore, the position and mass_to_charge concepts point to specific instances
                to use for this analysis.
