        * `A. Saxena et al. &lt;https://www.github.com/eisenforschung/CompositionSpace.git&gt;`_
        
        This is an application definition for the common NFDI-MatWerk/FAIRmat infrastructure
        use case IUC09 that explores how to improve the organization and results storage of the
        CompositionSpace tool by using the NeXus data model and semantics.

                Reconstructions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated via
                a file which stores the reconstructed position and mass-to-charge-state-ratio

                Container file formats like HDF5, such as NeXus/HDF5 files using :ref:`NXapm`,

                Ranging definitions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated via
                a file which stores the mass-to-charge-state-ratio interval and the number of elements
                of which each (molecular) ion is composed. These values are stored for each ion.
                
                Container file formats like HDF5, such as NeXus/HDF5 files using :ref:`NXapm`,
                can store multiple ranging definitions.
                
                Indices of ions start from 1. The value 0 is reserved for the null model of unranged positions
                whose iontype is referred to as the unknown_type. The value 0 is also reserved for voxels
                that lie outside the dataset.
