<!--it is useful to define own base classes for frequently used classes
a polyhedron is a specific polytope in 3d, do we need
higher-dimensional polytopes? that could be useful for simplicies though
as they are used in numerics etc. maybe reach out here to our friends
from MarDI, for now let's assume we do not need polytopes for d > 3-->

         Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra in Euclidean space.
         
         The tetrahedra do not have to be connected.
         As tetrahedral elements they are among hexahedral elements one of the most
         frequently used geometric primitive for meshing and describing volumetric
         and surface descriptions of objects at the continuum scale.
         
         A set of tetrahedra in 3D Euclidean space.
         
         The tetrahedra do not have to be connected, can have different size,
         can intersect, and be rotated.
         
         Tetrahedra are the simplest and thus important geometrical primitive.
         They are frequently used as elements in finite element meshing/modeling.
         
         Tetrahedra have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of triangles
         which are not self-intersecting.

        <doc>
             Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
             tetrahedra. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the

             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
