    <!--depending on the dimensionality n_p is correlated but not necessarily, e.g. for d==3 one can store quaternions (n_p==4) or Bunge-Euler angles (n_p==3)
clearly one could think about a single best approach that everybody should use, and indeed quaternions could be a candidate but this conflicts with the
expectations understanding and in fact habit by very many materials engineers who know and report their values in Euler angles so at least one would need to
have a system in place which converts...-->

an instance of an NXorientation_set is useful as attribute (meta)data to a set of microstructural objects e.g. crystals, grains when the base class is stored as a sub-ordinate of the grain_set
one may argue we expect that for each grain there is an orientation value, in this case the indexing is implicit and this is often used in computer simulations
without making a specific statement that e.g. the 0-th value of the array gives the volume of the 0-th grain but that 0-th grain might not necessarily be named as grain 0 but e.g. grain 23
because many computer simulations deal with ensemble where the number of objects changes over time, e.g. molecular dynamics simulation treat always the same set of atoms but post-processing
of the data may reveal these atoms are grouped/labelled as different microstructural features (grains, dislocations, vacancies) and then the names/identifiers of the objects may change over time
therefore the idea to specify if we use implicit or explicit indexing and listing of the indices because I know of colleagues where even that went havoc!-->
    <field name="objects">
        <doc>
             A link or reference to the objects whose identifier are referred to in
             identifier to resolve which row tuple is the orientation of each object
             by reading orientations.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="identifier_offset" type="NX_INT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
             Integer which specifies which orientation (row of array orientation) matches
             to which object.e first index to be used for distinguishing
             hexahedra. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
             interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="identifier" type="NX_INT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
             Integer used to distinguish how a row in orientation describes a specific
             object with an explicit identifier that can be queried via inspecting the
             list of available objects in objects.
             
             The rational behind having such a more complicated pattern is that not
             all objects referred when following the link in objects may still exists
             or are still tracked when the orientation set was characterized.
             
             This design enables to also use NXorientation_set in situations where
             the orientation of objects change as a function in time.

    <!--e.g. in this way one could easily, efficiently, store and map familiar habits of microscopists
to store e.g. orientations of measurement points or of grains via a (c := Ngrains, n_p := 3)
matrix of Bunge-Euler angles, or of (c := Ngrains, n_p := 4) matrix of quaternions.-->
    <!--the benefit of such a representation is that with a known NXorientation_set base class one can implement a common parameterization transformation library (of which several already exist) in the microstructure modelling communities so that a program can read the information in the (NXorientation_set) instance and automatically transform/compute between different parameterizations. Super relevant for interoperability e.g. in SEM/EBSD, where this was a long standing issue and right now the most frequently accepted consensus is to report either Bunge-Euler angles or quaternions and then use existent transformation libraries (as implemented by e.g. Marc de Graeff for SEM/EBSD and used by many but not yet the majority of people in the computational materials modelling community within crystal plasticity, crystal growth modeling, DREAM.3D)-->
