<!--The respective partner application definition NXxray_fourd
can be used for storing data and post-processing results of X-ray diffraction
experiments which can yield also orientation maps in one, two- or three-dimensions.

 These complementary techniques and associated application definitions can be used
 to inform NXms, another partner application definition to NXem_ebsd. NXms describes
 the connection between measured or simulated structural features with a focus of
 the length and time-scale coarser then the atomic scale. The term microstructure
 is used here but is not restricted to features at the micron scale.-->
<!--the IUCr DMI should work on an e.g. NXhedm
NXem_tkd is not needed as it can be covered by NXem_ebsd as well.
if we think of the metadata/data graph collected from the microscope session
documented in NXem there may be only a few relations between nodes of an instance
of NXem_ebsd and NXem. Key data from NXem which many users would expect to find
also enumerated in NXem_ebsd could be settings of the microscope, timestamp data
when tasks were performed at the microscope using which specimen, operated
and prepared by whom. These latter pieces of information are all available
in NXem but if we were to make fields in NXem deep inside an instance
of NXem_event_data required than we factually more and more granularize and
pull in steps of detailed numerical post-processing which arguably is not
any longer at all necessarily related to the microscope session.
We know many cases in EBSD community, see the work of e.g. Marc de Graef's group
or of Hakon Wiik Anes and Knut Marthinsen who spent much longer with a collected
dataset in post-processing than collecting it at the microscope. Therefore, we
need to have the flexibility that documentation of the actual microscope session
and the post-processing of some of the data therein collected remain coupled
but not too repetively and with too stiff constraints on the existence of specific
fields as otherwise there can be contradictions for which NXem_ebsd would no longer
be applicable when one wishes to remain at the same time conformant with the data
scheme.
The idea used here is to use a reference to another NeXus file in the NXem_ebsd
file instance and the NXem file instance. So far we acknowledge that exporting
data as an NXem application definition is limited and scientists currently have
specific file formats from commercial or open-source tools to work with.
Therefore, we so far model the connections between the application definitions
as NXprocesses. As soon as NXem is more supported these NXclasses should become
NXem e.g. though.
Details about scan positions should not be reproduced unless needed for
interpolating between results of neighboring scan positions.
Currently, we suggest to leave the scan positions as closely to where they are
collected, i.e. inside NXem.
What this exampe of linking information rather than duplicating shows is that
somewhat a culture change is needed: Instead of packing everything in one file
we just need to assure that we have a tool whereby we can follow and inspect a
set of linked objects if you would like to say so, also having multiple files
is okay.
Finally, this application definition makes any assumptions about
gridding, this enables to handle all sort of scan schemes.
We follow the argumentation of MTex, in certain cases data will not yield
fully occupied grids anyway.
NXem_ebsd could also be useful/used for storing generic simulations of EBSD pattern
which is one example for simulations of diffractions patterns as they may be observed
with electron microscopes. In this case, there should be simulation(NXprocess) under this
the simulation group where one can store the minimum required set of pieces of information
which comes with every diffraction pattern simulation.
The main problem is in this case that the simulation group is required but then there must
either be no measurement group and on_the_fly_indexing group, and eventually calibration ?
or these groups should be created but remain empty.
Using the current NeXus appdef design and rules for setting constraints demands that then the
same appdef should be used for post-processing measured data. So there is a conflict:
The simulation must not be required and measurement must not be optional.
Arguably one may call for two application definitions in this case but most constraints and
concepts would then match those of NXem_ebsd which works again standardization and
reducing the total number of ontologies.-->

         Application definition for collecting and indexing Kikuchi pattern into orientation maps.
         
         This NXem_ebsd application is a proposal how to represent data, metadata, and
         connections between these for the research field of electron microscopy.
         More specifically, exemplified here for electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).
         The application definition solves two key documentation issues which are missing
         so far to document provenance of data and metadata in the field of EBSD.
         The application definition can be an example that is relevant for related
         workflows in orientation microscopy.
         
         Firstly, an instance of NXem_ebsd (such as a NeXus/HDF5 file which is formatted
         according to the NXem_ebsd application definition) stores the connection between
         the microscope session and the key datasets which are considered typically results
         of the various processing steps involved when working with EBSD data.
         
         Different groups in this application definition make connections to data artifacts
         which were collected when working with electron microscopes via the NXem partner
         application definition. Using a file which stores information according to the
         NXem application definition has the benefit that it connects the sample, references
         to the sample processing, the user operating the microscope, details about the
         microscope session, and details about the acquistion and eventual indexing of
         Kikuchi pattern, associated overview images, like secondary electron or
         backscattered electron images of the region-of-interest probed and many
         more pieces of information.
         
         Secondly, this NXem_ebsd application definition connects and stores the conventions
         and reference frames which were used and are the key to mathematically correctly
         interpret every EBSD result. Otherwise, results would be ripped out of their
         context, as it is the situation with many traditional studies where EBSD data were
         indexed on-the-fly and shared with the community only via sharing the results file
         with some technology-partner-specific file but leaving important conventions out
         or relying on the assumptions that colleagues know these even though multiple
         definitions are possible.
         
         This application definition covers experiments with one-, two-dimensional, and
         so-called three-dimensional EBSD datasets. The third dimension is either time
         (in the case of quasi in-situ experiments) or space (in the case of serial-
         sectioning) methods where a combination of mechanical or ion milling is used
         repetitively to measure the same region-of-interest at different depth increments.
         Material removal can be achieved with electron or ion polishing, using manual
         steps or using automated equipment like a robot system.
         
         Three-dimensional experiments require to follow a sequence of specimen, surface
         preparation, and data collection steps. By nature these methods are destructive
         in that they either require the removal of the previously measured material region
         or that the sample surface can degrade due to e.g. contamination or other
         electron-matter interaction.
         
         For three-dimensional EBSD, multiple two-dimensional EBSD orientation mappings are
         combined into one reconstructed stack. That is serial-sectioning is mainly a
         computational workflow. Users collect data for each serial sectioning step
         via an experiment. This assures that data for associated microscope sessions
         and steps of data processing stay connected and contextualized.
         
         Eventual tomography methods also use such a workflow because first diffraction
         images are collected (e.g. with X-ray) and then these imagres are indexed and
         computed into a 3D orientation mapping. The here proposed NXem_ebsd application
         definition contains conceptual ideas how this splitting between measurement and
         post-processing can be granularized also for such X-ray-based techniques, whether
         it be 3DXRD or HEDM.

                 Details about simulations for Kikuchi pattern using kinematic or dynamic

                 spherical Kikuchi images which only when projected or observed in some
                 region-of-interest will represent a set of rectangular Kikuchi pattern

                 Therefore, these pattern should be stored. The spherical diffraction
                 pattern can be stored as a set of triangulated geodesic meshes.

                 The experiment group captures relevant details about the conditions of
                 and the tools used for collecting the Kikuchi diffraction pattern.
                 
                 The most frequently collected EBSD data are captured as rectangular ROIs
                 composed from square or hexagonally-shaped pixels. Substantially less
                 frequently, because such experiments are more costly and technically
                 demanding, correlated experiments are performed.
                 
                 One important class of such correlated experiments are the so-called
                 (quasi) in-situ experiments. Here the same or nearly the same ROI is
                 analyzed via a cycles of thermomechanical treatment, sample preparation,
                 measurement, on-the-fly-indexing. Phenomena investigated like this are
                 recrystallization, strain accumulation, material damage.
                 Post-processing is required to correlate and reidentify eventual
                 features or local ROIs across several orientation maps.
                 
                 Another important class of correlated experiments are the so-called
                 serial-sectioning experiments. Here the same sample is repetitively measured
                 and polished to create a stack of orientation data which can be reconstructed
                 to a three-dimensional volume ROI.

                <doc>
                     The EBSD system, including components like the electron gun, pole-piece,
                     stage tilting, EBSD detector, and the gnomonic projection have to be
                     calibrated to achieve reliable results. Specifically, the gnomonic projection
                     has to be calibrated.
                     
                     In most practical cases, especially in engineering, there is a substantially
                     larger number of sessions where such a calibrated system is used assuming
                     that somebody has properly calibrated the system rather than that the user
                     actively recalibrates it or is even allowed to do so.
                     Especially the projection geometry has to calibrated which is usually
                     achieved with measuring silicon, quartz or standards, and comparing
                     against simulated diffraction pattern.
                     
                     In the first case, the user assumes that the principle geometry of the
                     hardware components and the settings in the control and EBSD pattern
                     acquisition software are calibrated. Consequently, users pick from an
                     existent library of phase candidates. One example are the CRY or CIF
                     files of the classical HKL/Channel 5/Flamenco software products.
                     Each entry of the library of such phase candidates in this NeXus proposal
                     is represented by one NXem_ebsd_crystal_structure_model base class.
                     For each phase an instance of this base class is to be used to store
                     crystallographic and simulation-relevant data.
                     
                     Indexing is a data processing step performed after/during the beam scans
                     the specimen (depends on configuration). Users load the specimen, and first
                     collect a coarse image of the surface. Next, an approximate value for the
                     calibrated working distance is chosen and the stage tilted.
                     Users then may configure the microscope for collecting higher quality data
                     and push in the EBSD detector. Subsequently, they fine tune the illumination
                     and aberration settings and select one or multiple ROIs to machine off.
                     The on-the-fly indexing parameter are defined and usually the automated
                     measurement queue started.
                     
                     Nowadays, this is usually an automated/unsupervised process. The pattern
                     collection runs during the allocated session time slot which the user has
                     booked ends or when the queue finishes prematurely. Kikuchi pattern surplus
                     eventually multi-modal detector signals are collected and usually indexed
                     on-the-fly. The Kikuchi patterns may or not be deleted directly after a
                     solution was found (on-the-fly) so Kikuchi pattern are not always stored.
                     
                     Results files are in many labs afterwards copied automatically
                     for archival purposes to certain storage locations. The result of such an
                     EBSD measurement/experiment is a set of usually proprietary or open files
                     from technology partners (microscope and EBSD detector manufacturers).
                     
                     In the second case, the system is being calibrated during the session
                     using standards (silicon, quartz, or other common specimens).
                     There is usually one person in each lab responsible for doing such
                     calibrations. Important is that often this person or technician(s) are also
                     in charge of configuring the graphical user interface and software
                     with which most users control and perform their analyses.
                     For EBSD this has key implications because, taking TSL OIM/EDAX as an example,
                     the conventions how orientations are stored is affected by how reference frames
                     are set up and this setup is made at the level of the GUI software.
                     Unfortunately, these pieces of information are not necessarily stored
                     in the results files. In effect, key conventions become disconnected
                     from the data so it remains the users personal obligation to remember these
                     settings, write them down in the lab notebook, or these metadata get lost.
                     All these issues are a motivation and problem which NXem_ebsd solves.

                         When NXem is not used or the aim is to rather explore first how
                         community-specific files with EBSD data, such as ANG, CPR, or HDF5-
                         based formats can be parsed from, inject here the name of that file.
                         
                         The em_om parser will currently not interpret the majority of the
                         many system- and technique-specific metadata which come with the
                         files from e.g. technology partners. This is because the current
                         culture in the EBSD community is that many of the metadata fields
                         are neither in all cases fully documented nor use a standardized
                         vocabulary although many people understand terms from different
                         implementations and how these metadata can likely be compared to
                         one another.
                         
                         In addition, it is common practice in the research field of EBSD that
                         users transcode their raw data into other (often text-based or HDF5)
                         files with custom formatting to realize an information transfer
                         between specific software tools including commercial software from
                         technology partner, custom scripts in Matlab using tools like MTex,
                         or Python scripting with tools like hyperspy, pyxem, orix, diffsims,
                         kikuchipy, or EBSD data stack alignment tools like DREAM.3D.
                         We have opted that in the first iteration this implementation of a
                         RDMS-agnostic FAIR data schema for EBSD that we discard these metadata
                         because these ad hoc file formats are not designed to communicate
                         also specifically and most importantly the eventually different context
                         of the metadata.
                         Another reason for this choice was also to emphasize that in fact such
                         challenges do exist in the community and thus pointing them out may
                         support the discussion to arrive at eventually more complete solutions.
                         As developing these solutions should not be our authority and necessarily
                         demands feedback from the technology partners, we have opted for this
                         intermediate approach to stimulate discussion.

                     Fundamentally different algorithms can be used to index EBSD/EBSP pattern.
                     
                     Common is that pattern indexing is a computational step of comparing
                     simulated with measured diffraction pattern. Quality descriptors are defined
                     based on which an indexing algorithm yields a quantitative measure of
                     how similar measured and assumed/simulated pattern are, and thus if
                     no, one, or multiple so-called solutions were found.

                     and Hough transforms and how they relate by M. van Ginkel et al.).
                     Recently, dictionary-based indexing methods are increasingly becoming used
                     partly driven by the move to use artificial intelligence algorithms.
                     
                     An inspection of publicly available EBSD datasets with an open-source
                     license which are available on Zenodo was performed prior to implementing
                     of the associated em_om parser for NXem_ebsd. This analysis revealed that
                     EBSD data are in most cases stored in two ways: Case one was via a file in
                     formats from technology partners. Examples are binary formats like OSC,
                     H5OINA, OIP, EBSP, and many derived text-based formats like CPR, CRC, ANG,
                     CTF, HKL and more. Recently, there is trend towards using HDF5-based formats.
                     
                     These files contain some result and metadata to the numerical steps and the
                     computational workflow which was performed to index Kikuchi pattern
                     on-the-fly. Examples of metadata include scan point positions, indexing
                     solutions per scan point, some quality descriptors for the solutions,
                     as well as crystal structure and phase metadata.
                     
                     Case two were raw pattern in some custom format, often text-based with
                     some but in general no conclusive and interoperable representation of all
                     relevant metadata.
                     Often it remains unclear what individual fields and data arrays of these
                     fields resolve and/or mean conceptually. For some fields, publications were
                     referred to. However, software tools change over time and thus which specific
                     data end in a file and which specific conceptual information is behind
                     these data can change with software versions.
                     
                     Other cases were storing results of custom post-processing steps and
                     associated Kikuchi pattern. Testing of advanced indexing, pseudo-symmetry
                     resolving methods, i.e. any sort of prototyping or alternative indexing
                     strategies so far seem to require some flexibility for implementing
                     rapid prototypic capabilities. The drawback of this is that such results
                     come formatted on a case-by-case basis and are thus not interoperable.
                     
                     Therefore, we first need to collect how these files have been generated
                     and which metadata in these files (or database entries) represent
                     which pieces of information conceptually. Ideally, one would do so by
                     creating a complete set of information in e.g. an NXem application definition,
                     such as a log of timestamped events and processing steps, metadata and data.
                     Eventually even interactions with the graphical user interface of commercial
                     software during the microscope session should be stored and become a
                     part of the application definition.
                     
                     Such a set of pieces of information could then be used via reading directly
                     for the NXem application definition. However, in most cases such a data
                     representation is not available yet.

                         Therefore, the on_the_fly_indexing group stores which source_file contains
                         the results of the on-the-fly indexing. For commercial systems these files
                         can be e.g. ANG, CPR/CRC, H5OINA, OSC. It is possible that the file or
                         database entry which is referred to under origin is the same as the one
                         under a given acquisition/origin in one of the experiment groups.
                         This is because some commercial file formats make no clear distinction
                         between which metadata are acquisition and/or indexing metadata.

                         How many phases i.e. crystal structure models were used to index each
                         scan point if any? Let's assume an example to explain how this field
                         should be used: In the simplest case users collected one pattern for
                         each scan point and have indexed using one phase, i.e. one instance
                         of an NXem_ebsd_crystal_structure_model.
                         
                         In another example users may have skipped some scan points (not indexed)
                         them at all) and/or used differing numbers of phases for different scan
                         points.
                         
                         The cumulated of this array decodes how phase_identifier and phase_matching
                         arrays have to be interpreted. In the simplest case (one pattern per scan
                         point, and all scan points indexed using that same single phase model),
                         phase_identifier has as many entries as scan points
                         and phase_matching has also as many entries as scan points.

                         The array n_phases_per_scan_point details how the phase_identifier

                         For the example with a single phase phase_identifier has trivial
                         values either 0 (no solution) or 1 (solution matching
                         sufficiently significant with the model for phase 1).
                         
                         When there are multiple phases, it is possible (although not frequently
                         needed) that a pattern matches eventually (not equally well) sufficiently
                         significant with multiple pattern. This can especially happen in cases of
                         pseudosymmetry and more frequently with an improperly calibrated system
                         or false or inaccurate phase models e.g. (ferrite, austenite).
                         Having such field is especially relevant for recent machine learning
                         or dictionary based indexing schemes because in combination with
                         phase_matching these fields communicate the results in a model-agnostic
                         way.

                         which are organized in sequence: The solutions for the 0-th scan point,

                         Default inverse pole figure (IPF) plot of the data specific for each
                         phase. No ipf_mapID instances for non-indexed scan points as these are
                         by definition assigned the null phase with phase_identifier 0.
                         
                         The IPF mapping is interpolated from the scan point data mapping
                         onto a rectangular domain with square pixels and the
                         orientations colored according to the coloring scheme used in the
                         respective ipf_color_modelID/program.
                         
                         The main purpose of the ipf_mapID group is not to keep raw data or
                         scan point related data but offer a default way how a research data
                         management system can display a preview of the dataset so that users
                         working with the RDMS can get an overview of the dataset.
                         
                         This matches the first aim of NXem_ebsd which is foremost to bring
                         colleagues and users of EBSD together to discuss which pieces of information
                         need to be stored together. We are convinced a step-by-step design and
                         community-driven discussion about which pieces of information should
                         and/or need to be included is a practical strategy to work towards an
                         interoperable description and data model for exchanging
                         data from EBSD between different tools and research data management
                         systems (RDMS).
                         
                         With this design the individual RDMS solutions and tools can still continue
                         to support specific custom data analyses workflow and routes but at least
                         there is then one common notation of understanding whereby also users
                         not necessarily expert in all the details of the EBSD story can understand
                         better these data and thus eventually this can motivate data reuse and
                         repurposing.
                         
                         It is important to mention that we cannot assume, at least for now,
                         that the parser which writes to an NXem_ebsd-compliant file is also
                         responsible or capable at all of computing the inverse pole figure
                         color keys and maps itself. This cannot be assumed working because
                         this mapping of orientation data uses involved mathematical algorithms
                         and functions which not every tools used in the EBSD community is capable
                         of using or is for sure not using in exactly the same way.
                         
                         Currently, we assume it is the responsibilty of the tool used which
                         generated the data under on_the_fly_indexing to compute these
                         plots and deliver these to the parser.
                         
                         Specific case studies have been explored by the experiment team of
                         Area B of the FAIRmat project to realize and implement such mapping.
                         
                         The first case study uses the H5OINA format and the pyxem/orix library.
                         As orix is a Python library, the coloring is performed by the em_om parser.
                         
                         The second case study uses MTex and its EBSD color coding model.
                         As MTex is a Matlab tool, an intermediate format is written from MTex
                         first which stores these pieces of information. The parser then pulls
                         these data from the intermediate Matlab-agnostic representation and
                         supplements the file with missing pieces of information as it is
                         required by NXem_ebsd.
                         
                         The third case study shows how a generic set of Kikuchi pattern
                         can be loaded with the em_om parser. The pattern are loaded directly
                         from a ZIP file and mapped to an simulation image section for now.
                         
                         The fourth case study uses the DREAM.3D package which provides an own
                         set of EBSD data post-processing procedures. DREAM.3D documents the
                         processing steps with a pipeline file which is stored inside DREAM.3D
                         output files. In this case study, the parser reads the DREAM.3D file
                         and maps data relevant from the perspective of NXem_ebsd plus adds
                         relevant IPF color maps as they were computed by DREAM.3D.
                         Given that in this case the origin of the data is the DREAM.3D file
                         again provenance is kept and more details can be followed upon when
                         resolving origin.
                         
                         These examples offer a first set of suggestions on how to make EBSD
                         data injectable into research data management system using schemes
                         which themselves are agnostic to the specific RDMS and interoperable.
                         Steps of collecting the raw data and post-processing these with custom
                         scripts like MTex or commercial tools so far are mainly undocumented.
                         The limitation is that a program which consumes results or dump files
                         from these tools may not have necessarily all the sufficient information
                         available to check if the injected orientation data and color models
                         are matching the conventions which a user or automated system has
                         injected into an electronic lab notebook from which currently the em_om
                         parser collects the conventions and stores them into this NXem_ebsd instance.
                         The immediate benefit of the here presented NXem_ebsd concept though
                         is that the conventions and reference frame definitions are expected
                         in an ELN-agnostic representation to make NXem_ebsd a generally useful
                         data scheme for EBSD.
                         
                         Ideally, the em_om parser would load convention-compliant EBSD data
                         and use subsequently a community library to transcode/convert orientation
                         conventions and parameterized orientation values. Thereafter, convention-
                         compliant default plot(s) could be created that would be truely interoperable.
                         
                         However, given the variety of post-processing tools available surplus
                         the fact that these are not usually executed along standardized
                         post-processing workflows which perform exactly the same algorithmic steps,
                         this is currently not a practically implementable option. Indeed, first
                         developers who wish to implement this would first have to create a library
                         for performing such tasks, mapping generally between conventions,
                         i.e. map and rotate coordinate systems at the parser level.
                         
                         The unfortunate situation in EBSD is that due to historical reasons
                         and competitive strategies, different players in the field have
                         implemented (slightly) different approaches each of which misses
                         some part of a complete workflow description which is behind EBSD analyses:
                         Sample preparation, measurement, indexing, post-processing, paper...
                         
                         The here exemplified default plot do not so far apply relevant rotations
                         but takes the orientation values as they come from the origin and using
                         coloring them as they come. It is thus the scientists responsibility to
                         enter and check if the respective dataset is rotation-conventions-wise
                         consistent and fit for a particular task.
                         
                         Ideally, with all conventions defined it can be possible to develop
                         a converter which rotates the input data. This application definition
                         does not assume this and users should be aware of this limitation.
                         
                         The key point is that the conventions however are captured and this is
                         the most important step to the development of such a generic transcoder
                         for creating interoperable EBSD datasets.
                         
                         Currently the conventions remain in the mind or manual lab book of the
                         respective scientists or technicians instead of getting stored and
                         communicated with research papers that are written based on
                         specific dataset, i.e. database entries.
                         
                         The default gridded representation of the data should not be
                         misinterpreted as the only possible way how EBSD data and OIM
                         maps can be created!
                         
                         Indeed, the most general case is that patterns are collected for
                         scan points. The scan generator of an electron microscope is instructed
                         to steer the beam in such a way across the specimen surface that the
                         beam illuminates certain positions for a certain amount time (usually
                         equally-spaced and spending about the same amount of time at each
                         position).
                         
                         Therefore, scan positions can be due to such regular flight plans and
                         represent sampling on lines, line stacks, rectangular regions-of-
                         interests, but also could instruct spiral, random, or adaptive scans
                         instead of tessellations with square or hexagonal pixels.
                         
                         The majority of EBSD maps is though is reporting results for a regular
                         grid (square, hexagon). What matters though in terms of damage induced
                         by the electron beam and signal quality is the real electron dose
                         history, i.e. for how long the beam exposed which location of the
                         specimen. Especially when electron charging occurs (i.e. an excess
                         amount of charge accumulates due to e.g. poor conducting away of this
                         charge or an improper mounting, too high dose, etc. such details are
                         relevant.
                         
                         Specifically, the default visualization is an inverse pole-figure (IPF)
                         map with the usual RGB color coding. Different strategies and
                         normalization schemes are in use to define such color coding.
                         
                         Finally, we should mention that each ipf_map represents data for
                         scan points indexed as one phase. The alias/name of this phase should
                         be stored in phase_name, the phase_identifier give an ID which must
                         not be zero as this value is reserved for non-indexed / null model scan
                         points.

                             For each stereographic standard triangle (SST), i.e. a rendering of
                             the fundamental zone of the crystal-symmetry-reduced orientation space SO3,
                             it is possible to define a color model which assigns each point in
                             the fundamental zone a color.
                             Different mapping models are in use and implement (slightly) different
                             scaling relations. Differences are which base colors of the RGB
                             color model are placed in which extremal position of the SST
                             and where the white point is located. For further details see:

                             Given that the SST has a complicated geometry, it cannot yet be
                             visualized using tools like H5Web, which is why for now the em_om
                             parsers takes a rasterized image which is rendered by the backend

                 This application definition also enables to describe a workflow where several
                 EBSD datasets are not only documented but also correlated based on time,
                 position (spatial), or both (spatiotemporal).
                 
                 Spatial correlations between repetitively characterized regions-of-interests
                 are typically correlated using image registration and alignment algorithms.
                 For this typically so-called landmarks are used. These can be grains with
                 a very large size or specific shape, i.e. grains which are qualitatively
                 different enough to be used as a guide how images are shifted relative to
                 one another. Other commonly used landmarks are fiducial marks which are
                 milled into the specimen surface using focus-ion beam milling and/or various
                 types of indentation methods.
                 
                 As far as the same physical region-of-interest is just measured several times,
                 the additional issue of the depth increment is not a concern. However, correct
                 assumptions for the depth increment, amount of material removed along the milling
                 direction is relevant for accurate and precise three-dimensional (serial-sectioning)
                 correlations. For these studies it can be tricky though to assume or estimate
                 useful depth increments. Different strategies have been proposed like
                 calibrations, wedged-shaped landmarks and computer simulation assisted
                 assumption making.
                 
                 Despite the use of landmarks, there are many practical issues which make the
                 processing of correlations imprecise and inaccurate. Among these are drift
                 and shift of the specimen, instabilities of the holder, the beam, irrespective
                 of the source of the drift, charging effects, here specifically causing local
                 image distortions and rotations which may require special processing algorithms
                 to reduce such imprecisions.
                 
                 Time correlations face all of the above-mentioned issues surplus the challenge
                 that specific experimental protocols have to be used to ensure the material state
                 is observed at specific physical time. The example of quasi in-situ characterization
                 of crystal growth phenomena, a common topic in engineering or modern catalysis research
                 makes it necessary to consider that e.g. the target value for the desired annealing
                 temperature is not just gauged based on macroscopic arguments but considers
                 that transient effects take place. Heating or quenching a sample might thus might
                 not have been executed under conditions in the interaction volume as they are
                 documented and/or assumed.
                 
                 These issue cause that correlations have an error margin as to how accurately
                 respective datasets were not only just synced based on the geometry of the
                 region-of-interests and the time markers but also to asssure which physical
                 conditions the specimen experienced over the course of the measurements.
                 
                 The fourth example of the em_om reference implementation explores the use of the
                 correlation group with a serial-sectioning datasets that was collected by the
                 classical Inconel 100 dataset collected by M. D. Uchic and colleagues
                 (M. Groeber M, Haley BK, Uchic MD, Dimiduk DM, Ghosh S 3d reconstruction and
                 characterization of polycrystalline microstructures using a fib-sem system data set.
                 Mater Charac 2006, 57 259–273. 10.1016/j.matchar.2006.01.019M).
                 
                 This dataset was specifically relevant in driving forward the implementation
                 of the DREAM.3D software. DREAM.3D is an open-source software project for
                 post-processing and reconstructing, i.e. correlating sets of orientation
                 microscopy data foremost spatially. One focus of the software is the
                 (post-)processing of EBSD datasets. Another cutting edge tool with similar
                 scope but a commercial solution by Bruker is QUBE which was developed by
                 P. Konijnenberg and coworkers.
                 
                 Conceptually, software like DREAM.3D supports users with creating linear
                 workflows of post-processing tasks. Workflows can be instructed via the
                 graphical user interface or via so-called pipeline processing via command line
                 calls. DREAM.3D is especially useful because its internal system documents all
                 input, output, and parameter of the processing steps. This makes DREAM.3D a
                 good candidate to interface with tools like em_om parser. Specifically, DREAM.3D
                 documents numerical results via a customized HDF5 file format called DREAM3D.
                 Workflow steps and settings are stored as nested dictionaries in JSON syntax
                 inside a supplementary JSON file or alongside the data in the DREAM3D file.
                 DREAM.3D has a few hundred algorithms implemented. These are called filters
                 in DREAM.3D terminology.
                 
                 Users configure a workflow which instructs DREAM.3D to send the data through
                 a chain of predefined and configured filters. Given that for each analysis
                 the filter is documented via its version tags surplus its parameter and setting
                 via a controlled vocabulary, interpreting the content of a DREAM3D HDF5 file
                 is possible in an automated manner using a parser. This makes DREAM.3D analyses
                 repeatable and self-descriptive. A key limitation though is that most frequently
                 the initial set of input data come from commercial files like ANG.
                 This missing link between the provenance of these input files, their associated
                 creation as electron microscope session, is also what NXem_ebsd solves.
                 
                 Nevertheless, as this can be solved with e.g. NXem_ebsd we are convinced that
                 the DREAM.3D and the em_om parser can work productively together to realize
                 RDMS-agnostic parsing of serial-section analyses.
                 
                 The internal documentation of the DREAM.3D workflow also simplifies the
                 provenance tracking represented by an instance of NXem_ebsd as not every
                 intermediate results has to be stored. Therefore, the fourth example
                 focuses on the key result obtained from DREAM.3D - the reconstructed
                 and aligned three-dimensional orientation map.
                 
                 Usually, this result is the starting point for further post-processing
                 and characterization of structural features. As here orientation microscopy
                 is insofar scale invariant using DREAM.3D, NXem_ebsd, and em_om should
                 be useful for different characterization methods, such as EBSD, Transmission
                 Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD), Automated Crystal Orientation Mapping (ACOM),
                 Nanobeam Electron Diffraction (using commercial systems like NanoMegas ASTAR)
                 or open-source implementations of these techniques (such as via pyxem/orix).
                 
                 The result of orientation microscopy methods are maps of local orientation
                 and thermodynamic phase (crystal structure) pieces of information. Virtually
                 all post-processing of such results for structural features includes again
                 a workflow of steps which are covered though by the NXms partner application
                 definition. The respective source of the data in an instance of NXms can
                 again be a link or reference to an instance of NXem_ebsd to complete the
                 chain of provenance.
