             Colloquial or short name for the deflector. For manufacturer names and

        </doc>
    </field>
    <group type="NXtransformations">
        <doc>
             Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and
             geometry of the deflector as a component in the instrument. Conventions from the
             NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
             system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
             component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
             relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
             all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
             the reference coordinate system.
