         Base class of the configuration and results of a delocalization algorithm.
         
         Delocalization is used to distribute point-like objects on a grid to obtain
         e.g. smoother count, composition, or concentration values of scalar fields
         and compute gradients of these fields.

    <!--for APM the speciality is nothing but:
each point marks the location of an ion (object) in the tomographic reconstruction
there is a boolean mask which filters which ions, i.e. points are considered
plus there is a weight interpretation model, specifically in atom probe
if a (molecular) ion is decomposed into its atoms or isotopes
plus, given there is such a weight interpretation model, there is a weight
associated, specifically an integer >= 1 with each considered ion and 0 for
all ions which are not considered,
this weight is the multiplicity with respect to the interpretation model
i.e. a C:2 molecular ion has a multiplicity of 2 if the ion is considered
and the interpretation model that to consider carbon atoms or carbon ions-->

                 As an example from the research field of atom probe points/objects are (molecular) ions.
                 Different methods are used for weighting ions:
                 
                 * default, points get all the same weight 1., which for atom probe is equivalent
                    to (molecular) iontype-based delocalization.
                 * element, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclide
                   with a proton number that is matching to a respective entry in whitelist.
                   In atom probe jargon, this means atomic_decomposition.
                 * isotope, points get as much weight as they have atoms representing a nuclides
                   from a respective entry in whitelist.
                   In atom probe jargon, this means isotope_decomposition.
