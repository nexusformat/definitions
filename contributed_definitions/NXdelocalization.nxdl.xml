         Base class to describe the delocalization of point-like objects on a grid.
         
         Such a procedure is for instance used in image processing and e.g. atom probe
         microscopy (APM) to discretize a point cloud onto a grid to enable e.g.
         computing of point density, composition, or concentration values, obtain
         scalar fields, and compute gradients of these fields.

    <!--for APM the speciality is nothing but:
each point marks the location of an ion (object) in the tomographic reconstruction
there is a boolean mask which filters which ions, i.e. points are considered
plus there is a weight interpretation model, specifically in atom probe
if a (molecular) ion is decomposed into its atoms or isotopes
plus, given there is such a weight interpretation model, there is a weight
associated, specifically an integer >= 1 with each considered ion and 0 for
all ions which are not considered,
this weight is the multiplicity with respect to the interpretation model
i.e. a C:2 molecular ion has a multiplicity of 2 if the ion is considered
and the interpretation model that to consider carbon atoms or carbon ions-->
    <field name="weighting_model">
        <doc>
             The weighting model specifies how mark data are mapped to a weight per point.
             For atom probe microscopy (APM) as an example, different models are used which
             account differently for the multiplicity of an ion/atom:
             
             * default, points all get the same weight 1.;
               for APM this is equivalent to ion species
             * atomic_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have atoms
               of a type in element_whitelist,
             * isotope_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have
               isotopes of a type in isotope_whitelist.
             
             This description shows an example that could be reinterpreted for
             similar such data processing steps in other fields of science.
