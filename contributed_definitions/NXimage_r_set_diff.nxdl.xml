         Base class specialized for reporting a cuboidal stack of diffraction pattern.
         
         Diffraction pattern, whether they were simulated or measured are the raw data
         for computational workflows to characterize the phase and orientation
         of crystalline regions in matter.
         
         Steps of post-processing the diffraction patterns should be documented using
         method-specific specialized base classes. All eventual post-processing of
         resulting orientation maps (2D or 3D) should be documented via :ref:`NXms_recon`.
         
         To implement an example how this base class can be used we focused in FAIRmat
         on Kikuchi diffraction pattern here specifically the research community
         of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD).
         
         For this reason, this base class and the :ref:`NXem_ebsd` base class extend the
         work of `M. A. Jackson et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-9772-3-4&gt;`_
         (one of the developers of DREAM.3D) and the H5OINA public file format developed by
         `P. Pinard et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621006103&gt;`_ with Oxford Instruments.
         
         Kikuchi pattern are typically collected with FIB/SEM microscopes,
         for two- and three-dimensional orientation microscopy.
         
         For a detailed overview of these techniques see e.g.
         
         * `M. A. Groeber et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-9772-3-5&gt;`_
         * `A. J. Schwartz et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-3205-4&gt;`_

         Serial-sectioning demands a recurrent sequence of ion milling and measuring.
         This suggests that each serial section is at least an own NXevent_data_em
         instance. The three-dimensional characterization as such demands a computational
         step where the maps for each serial section get cleaned, aligned, and registered
         into an image stack. This image stack represents a digital model of the
         inspected microstructural volume. Often this volume is called a (representative)
         volume element (RVE). Several software packages exists for performing
         these post-processing tasks.
         
         This example may inspire users of other types of diffraction methods.

             Collected diffraction pattern as an image stack. As raw and closest to the
             first retrievable measured data as possible, i.e. do not use this
             container to store already averaged, filtered or whatever post-processed
             pattern unless these are generated unmodifiably in such manner by the
             instrument given the way how the instrument and control software
             was configured for your microscope session.

            <doc>
                 Array which resolves the scan point to which each pattern belongs.
                 
                 Scan points are evaluated in sequence starting from scan point zero
                 until scan point n_sc - 1. Evaluating the cumulated of this array
                 decodes which pattern in intensity belongs to which scan point.
                 
                 Take an example with three scan points: The first scan point has one
                 pattern, the second has three pattern, the last scan point has no
                 pattern. In this case the scan_point_identifier are 0, 1, 1, 1.
                 The length of the scan_point_identifier array is four because four
                 pattern were measured in total.
                 
                 In most cases usually one pattern is averaged by the detector for
                 some amount of time and then reported as one pattern.

    <!-- If we envision a (knowledge) graph for EBSD it consists of individual sub-graphs
 which convey information about the specimen preparation, the measurement of
 the specimen in the electron microscope, the indexing of the collected
 Kikuchi pattern stack, eventual post-processing of the indexed orientation
 images via similarity grouping algorithms to yield (grains, texture).
 Conceptually, these post-processing steps are most frequently serving
 the idea how can one reconstruct so-called microstructural features
 (grains, phases, interfaces) to  infer material properties.
 In practice this calls for workflows which quantify correlations between
the spatial arrangement of the microstructural features, the individual
 (thermodynamic, chemo-mechanical) properties of the features with the
 properties of materials at a coarser scale.
 With NXem and related NXms base classes we propose a covering
 and general solution how to handle such (meta)data with NeXus.-->
