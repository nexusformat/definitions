         Characterization and session with one sample in an electron microscope.
         
         **The idea and aim of NXem**:
         Electron microscopes (EM), whether it be a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
         or a transmission electron microscope (TEM), are versatile tools for preparing
         and characterizing samples and specimens. The term specimen is here understood
         as a synonym for a sample. A specimen is a physical portion of material that
         is studied/characterize in the microscope session, eventually in different
         places on the specimen surface.
         These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).
         
         Fundamentally, an EM is an electron accelerator. Experimentalists use an EM
         in sessions during which they characterize as well as prepare specimens.
         This application definition describes data and metadata about processes and
         characterization tasks applied to one specimen.
         
         Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple NXentry instances.
         
         There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
         operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of 
         (staff) scientists. These users perform analyses for other users as a service
         task. Oftentimes, though, and especially for cutting-edge instruments,
         the scientists and their team guide the process while operating the
         microscope. Oftentimes the scientists operate the instrument themselves
         either on-site or remotely and can ask technicians for support.
         In all cases, these people are considered users. Users might have different
         roles though.
         
         The rational behind a common EM schema rather than separate SEM or TEM 
         schemata are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM instruments:
         Both have electro-magnetic lenses. These lens may differ in design, alignment,
         number, and level of corrected-for aberrations. As an obvious difference,
         a TEM is used mainly to measure the transmitted electron beam.
         This demands thinner specimens as in SEM but offers capabilities for probing 
         of additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction.
         
         Compared to SEMs, TEMs have a different relative arrangement between the
         lenses and the specimen which is most obvious by the different relative
         arrangement of the objective lens versus the specimen.
         
         Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
         measure different types of signals that originate though from the same set of
         radiation/specimen interactions. Consequently, detectors can also be similar.
         
         Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
         been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
         communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
         acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower
         the addressed user base is which develops or uses schemata for
         research data management with EM, the more understandable it is
         that scientists of either community (or sub-community) ask for
         method-specific schemata.
         
         Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
         may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
         an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
         Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
         (X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
         what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
         research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
         schemata such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.
         
         The development in the past has shown that these activities led to a zoo of
         schemata and implementations of these into many data and file formats.
         There is nothing which prevents the communities to make these schemata
         open and interoperable. Open here means specifically not that all data are
         compliant with/or use the schema and have to end up in the open-source domain.
         There can be embargo periods first of all. Open means that the metadata and 
         associated schemata are documented in a manner that as many details as 
         possible are open in the sense that others can understand what the 
         (meta)data mean conceptually. 
         The `FAIR principles &lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18&gt;`_ guide all 
         decisions how data and metadata should be stored.
         
         EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
         there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different 
         schemata with associated representations of data and metadata in EM:
         Each combination of schemata or an interoperable-made handshake between two
         file formats or software packages has to be maintained by software developers.
         This counts especially when data should be processed interoperably
         between software packages.
         
         This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
         between tools to maintain. This can result in usage of different terminology.
         Which in turn results in representations and connections made between 
         different data representations and workflows that are not machine-actionable.
         `There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology. &lt;https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary&gt;`_
         
         A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemata
         and scientists can take for instance then these terms as closely as possible.
         Ideally, they specialize the application definition only for the few very
         specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
         better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
         This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
         removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemata.
         
         Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemata rather than
         a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
         academia as it enables the EM community to focus their software development
         efforts on those schemata, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonize
         their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
         for vendors of EM hard- and software as it improves the longevity of certain
         schema and thus can help to incentivize vendors to support the community with
         implementing support for such schemata into their proprietary applications.
         
         In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
         in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
         interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.
         
         The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
         (EM-research specific base classes) for using NeXus to define schemata for
         electron microscopy research. Working towards a common vocabulary is a
         community activity that profits from everybody reflecting in detail whether
         certain terms they have used are not eventually conceptually similar if not
         the same as what this application definition and its base classes provide.
         
         We are happy for receiving your feedback.
         
         It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for) NeXus, schema differ
         already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
         but it is set optional in another version. If group(s), field(s), or
         attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemata can
         become inconsistent. An application definition here serves as a contract
         between a data provider and a data consumer. These two can be software tools
         (like the vendor software to drive the instrument or a scientific software
         for doing artificial intelligence with EM data).
         Such changes of a schema lead to new versions.
         
         Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against inconsistencies; however
         NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which schemata can be
         documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
         (at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
         not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable 
         and interoperable FAIR data.
         A common vocabulary and a machine-actionable knowledge representation/engine
         is also required. Essentially when the docstrings are no longer needed
         but can be replaced by a connection to an automated tool which understands
         what a specific field represents conceptually, EM data have become more
         generally interoperable EM data.
         
         This application definition takes a key step into this direction.
         It offers a controlled vocabulary and relation between concepts and data
         relevant for research with electron microscopes. To be most efficient and
         offering reusability, the application definition should be understood as a
         template that one should ideally use as is. This application definition
         is called NXem. It can be considered a base for more specialized definitions
         (ideally prefixed with NXem) *method*.
         
         **The use of NXem should be as follows:**
         Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but make
         them optional or, even better, propose changes in the application definition.
         
         A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
         their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
         corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
         of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
         For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
         detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
         may not be retrievable.
         
         EM experiments by design illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
         consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
         As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
         procedures and system setups should be addressed first.
         
         If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
         geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
         experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
         hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
         between clarity and being vendor-agnostic. Settings of apertures are an 
         example where aperture modes are aliases behind which there is a set of
         settings. These settings are difficult to retrieve, often undocumented in
         detail. This serves users and makes EM experiments easier understandable and
         conveniently executable for a broader user base. The opportunities for 
         application definitions to offer an abstraction layer are limited.
         
         Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
         eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting 
         the application definition and base classes is that there are numerous 
         (technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
         disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
         nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
         place to hold these nested representations; however at the cost of generality.
         
         Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
         a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
         if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
         it especially challenging if the application definition is expected to hold
         all data that might be of relevance for future questions.
         
         We are skeptical if there is one representation that can fulfill all these
         aims, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable by a large
         number of scientists in a community. With this application definition we 
         would like to motivate the community to work towards such aim. While doing
         so we found that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled
         vocabulary.
         
         We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
         SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
         common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.
         
         **This application definition has the following components at the top-level:**
         
         * Generic experimental details (timestamp, identifiers, name);  
           conceptually these are session details. A session at a microscope may  
           involve the characterization of multiple specimens. For each specimen  
           an instance of an (NXentry) is created. Details of the instrument have to  
           be stored at least in an entry. Other entries should refer to these  
           metadata via links to reduce redundancies.  
         * Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should  
           have an associated time stamp and report of the specific settings at that  
           point in time when the image was taken. The reason is that EMs can be  
           highly dynamic, be used to illuminate the specimen differently  
           or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.  
           What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement? This can be the  
           collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),  
           taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set  
           of EBSD line scan and surface mappings in an SEM, or ion-beam-milling of a  
           specimen in preparation for an atom probe experiment.  
         * NXmonitor;
           instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities  
           pertaining to specific components of the instrument. Alternatively  
           NXevent_data_em instances can be used to store timestamp states of the  
           components, which is relevant to document the exact settings when images  
           and spectra were taken.  
         * NXinstrument;
           conceptually this is a container to store arbitrary level of detail of the  
           technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which  
           it is operated.  
         * NXuser;
           conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details  
           who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be  
           referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store  
           individualized details who executed an event.  
         * NXevent_data_em instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;  
           each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details  
           about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and  
           relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).  
         * NXdata; a the top-level, conceptually, this is a place for documenting  
           available default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for  
           research data management systems to show a visual representation of some  
           aspect of the content of the EM session.  
           It is clear that what constitutes a useful default plot is a matter of  
           interpretation, somewhat of personal taste, and community standards.  
         
         In effect, default plottables are case- and method-specific.
         Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals and
         images. Examples for possible default plottables could be an arbitrarily
         taken: secondary, back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern,
         EELS spectra, composition, or orientation mappings to name but a few.
         
         **There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:**
         
         * Above images, spectra, and mappings should be stored as NXdata instances,  
           ideally formatted in such a way that they can be displayed with  
           visualization software that can be specific for the file format in which  
           the data are stored. NeXus specifies only the data model, i.e. the terms  
           and their relations. These descriptions can be implemented and stored in  
           JSON, HDF5, XML, or HSDS, file storage, or even other formats, although  
           HDF5 is the most commonly used.
         * Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of  
           data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible  
           electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.  
         * Images of electron counts detected in specific operation modes (bright  
           field, dark field in TEM, secondary/back-scattered, Kikuchi in SEM)  
         * Spectra (X-ray quanta or auger electron counts)  
         * These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical
           processing. It makes sense to name them with a controlled vocabulary,  
           e.g. SE (secondary electron), BSE (back-scattered electron), Kikuchi,  
           X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence) etc.  
         
         A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
         should be stored (in memory or on disk). To this end the schema, here makes no
         specific assumptions, not even that all the fields/group of a schema instance
         have to be stored into a single file. Instead, the schema specifies the
         relations between metadata, constraints on how they should be formatted, what
         they conceptually represent and which terms (controlled vocabulary) is
         practical to store with the data.
         
         In effect, the application definition is a graph which describes how
         (meta)data are related to one another.

                 for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
                 duration is not relevant - this start time field should be used.

                 with having both time instances specified, it may not be possible
                 to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data were acquired.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
                 to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
                 advantage of individual time stamps in NXevent_em instances to

                 Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
                 commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
                 In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
                 already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
                 at the microscope.
                 Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
                 interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
                 of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.
                 
                 It is possible that different types of programs might be used to 
                 perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is

                 The em_lab section contains a description of the instrument and its components.
                 The component descriptions in this section differ from those inside individual
                 NXevent_em sections. These event instances take the role of time snapshot.
                 For an NXevent_em instance users should store only those settings for a 
                 component which are relevant to understand the current state of the component.
                 Here, current means at the point in time, i.e. the time interval, 
                 which the event represents.
                 
                 For example it is not relevant to store in each event's electron_gun group
                 again the details of the gun type and manufacturer but only the high-voltage
                 if for that event the high-voltage was different. If for all events
                 the high-voltage was the same it is not even necessary to include an electron_gun
                 section in the event.

                 An event is a time point/interval during which the microscope
                 was configured in a specific way and the microscope was used
                 to take a measurement.
                 
                 Each NXevent_em holds an acquisition task with the microscope.
                 For instance the capturing of a secondary electron, backscattered
                 electron, diffraction image, or spectrum.
                 
                 An NXevent_em_data instance holds specific details about how raw data 
                 from a detector were processed into consumable data like images, spectra,
                 etc. These on-the-fly data processing tasks are usually performed
                 by the control software, eventually realized with custom scripts.
                 
                 Furthermore, NXevent_em_state instances can document specific values
                 and settings of the microscope during the snapshot/event.

                     one event, i.e. a point in time when the microscope had the

                     were constant over the entire course of microscope session
                     and thus all relevant metadata inside the NXinstrument groups
                     are sufficient to understand the session.

                         The detector or set of detectors that was used to collect this signal.
                         The name of the detector has to match one of the names of available
                         NXdetector instances e.g. if the instrument has an ebsd_camera
                         the detector for an NXimage_em_kikuchi should be the NXdetector
                         instance called ebsd_camera.
