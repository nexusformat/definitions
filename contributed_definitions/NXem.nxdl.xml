         Application definition for normalized representation of electron microscopy research.
         
         This application definition is a comprehensive example for a general description
         with which to normalize specific pieces of information and data collected within
         electron microscopy research.
         
         NXem is designed to be used for documenting experiments or computer simulations in which
         controlled electron beams are used for studying electron-beam matter interaction to explore
         physical mechanisms and phenomena, or to characterize materials with an electron microscope.

                 Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier for referring to this experiment.
                 
                 An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
                 in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an experiment
                 (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment *a test done in order to find out
                 something, eg if an idea is correct*).
                 
                 The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory, or the principle investigator.
                 The identifier enables to link experiments/simulations to e.g. proposals.

                 Free-text description about the experiment.
                 
                 Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
                 by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
                 into the field. The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
                 The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn in how far the
                 current base classes need extension based on user feedback.

                 ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
                 when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
                 codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
                 for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
                 duration is not relevant use this start_time field.
                 
                 Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both a start_time
                 and an end_time because this enables software tools and users to collect a
                 more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
                 
                 Users should be aware though that even with having both time instances
                 specified, it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or
                 for how long data were acquired.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
                 to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
                 advantage of individual time stamps start_time and end_time
                 in :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.

                 An example how to use this set could be to document from which files, which have been
                 e.g. generated by software of technology partners, the information in an instance of
                 NXem was filled with during parsing or transcoding between different formats.
                 
                 If resources from technology partners would also be documented with semantic
                 technology there would not even be a necessity to copy over specific information
                 into other files as one could write inference and information/fact/knowledge retrieval
                 algorithm(s) whereby a specific piece of information that is related to an experiment
                 or simulation is read directly from the respective file of the technology partner.
                 
                 The reason why currently this works convincingly in hardly any research data management system
                 (RDMS) is the strong heterogeneity of the information contained in such files and the fact
                 that often context and documentation, specifically rich and strongly expressive semantic
                 documentation or contextualization is underdeveloped.

NEW ISSUE: error estimates of the thickness and origin, i.e. how the value was obtained would be useful
NEW ISSUE: error model
NEW ISSUE: the KIT/SCC SEM, TEM schemata further qualify samples whether they are conductive e/ibeam sensitive
etc. The problem with this is that beam sensitivity is too vague but spatiotemporal electron dose integral dependent
KIT/SCC distinguish further conductivity and magnetic properties. While the motivation is clear, making
it thus simple is likely problematic when the data entered in such fields remaining qualitative.
what are good or bad properties, it would make sense though to quantify these values
this includes the description of eventual plasma cleaning steps,
just knowing that a sample was plasma cleaned is insufficient, maybe it was not cleaned long enough
if plasma cleaning is done outside the EM than its certainly history, if it happens inside the EM
are the ibeam description capabilities not sufficient enough?-->

                                         This is not always just the diameter of the aperture (not even in the case)
                                         of a circular aperture. Usually, it is a value that is set in the control
                                         software whereby a specific configuration of an aperture is selected by the
                                         software.
                                         
                                         The control software of commercial microscope typically offers the user
                                         access at a high abstraction level because of which many details about
                                         the actual settings of the electrical components are typically unknown.
                                         
                                         However, if more details are known or should be documented one should
