             Granularizing at the socket level.
             
             Typical examples follow: A desktop computer with a single GPU one
             could describe using one instance of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj` inside one instance of
             :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys`.
             A desktop computer with two GPUs one could describe using two instances
             of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj` inside one instance of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys`.
             A GPU server like nowadays used for artificial intelligence
             one could describe as a system with n instances of :ref:`NXcs_gpu_obj`
             in one :ref:`NXcs_gpu_sys` or :ref:`NXcs_cpu_sys`.
