         Spatial filter to filter entries within a region-of-interest based on their
         position.

    <field name="windowing_method">
        <doc>
             Qualitative statement which specifies which spatial filtering with respective
             geometric primitives or bitmask is used. These settings are possible:
             
             * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, the entire dataset is used.  
             * union_of_primitives, a filter with (rotated) geometric primitives.  
               All ions in or on the surface of the primitives are considered  
               while all other ions are ignored.  
             * bitmasked_points, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1  
               which ions should be included. Those ions whose bit is set to 0  
               will be excluded. Users of python can use the bitfield operations  
               of the numpy package to define such bitfields.  
             
             Conditions:
             In the case that windowing_method is entire_dataset all entries are processed.
             In the case that windowing_method is union_of_primitives,
             it is possible to specify none or all types of primitives
             (ellipsoids, cylinder, hexahedra). If no primitives are specified
             the filter falls back to entire_dataset.
             In the case that windowing_method is bitmask, the bitmask has to be defined;
             otherwise the filter falls back to entire dataset.
