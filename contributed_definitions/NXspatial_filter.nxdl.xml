        Base class for a spatial filter for objects within a region-of-interest (ROI).
        
        Objects can be points, objects composed from other geometric primitives,
        or objects.

    <field name="windowing_method" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Qualitative statement which describes the logical operations
            that define which objects will be included and which excluded:
            
            * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, all objects are included.
            * union_of_primitives, a filter with (possibly non-axis-aligned) geometric
              primitives. Objects in or on the surface of the primitives are included.
              All other objects are excluded.
            * bitmask, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1 which objects
              are included. Bits set to zero encode which objects are excluded.
              
            Users of python can use the bitfield operations of the numpy package to work with bitfields.
            Multiple instances of NXcg base classes are used to compose a union_of_primitives.
