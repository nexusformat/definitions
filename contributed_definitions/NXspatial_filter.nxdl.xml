    <doc>
         Base class for a spatial filter for objects within a region-of-interest (ROI).
         
         Objects can be points or objects composed from other geometric primitives.

    <field name="windowing_method" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Qualitative statement which describes the logical operations
             that define which objects will be included and which excluded:
             
             * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, all objects are included.
             * union_of_primitives, a filter with (possibly non-axis-aligned) geometric
               primitives. Objects in or on the surface of the primitives are included.
               All other objects are excluded.
             * bitmask, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1 which objects
               are included. Bits set to zero encode which objects are excluded.
               Users of python can use the bitfield operations
               of the numpy package to work with bitfields.

        <!--In the case that windowing_method is union_of_primitives,
it is possible to specify none or all types of primitives
(ellipsoids, cylinder, hexahedra). If no primitives are specified
the filter falls back to entire_dataset.
In the case that windowing_method is bitmask, the bitmask has to be defined;
otherwise the filter falls back to entire dataset.-->
