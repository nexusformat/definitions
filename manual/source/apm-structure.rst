Atom-probe tomography
=====================

Atom probe tomography and related field-ion microscopy, aka atom probe microscopy (techniques) cover metrology methods with an origin in the materials science and condensed-matter physics communities. With its maturation and commercialization in the last two decades atom probe is increasingly being used for characterization of bio materials and fundamental science of field evaporation physics.

The list of standardized data schemas for atom probe in NeXus is available here: :ref:`Appdef-Apm-Structure`.
A status report of additional ongoing work on NeXus data schemas for atom probe is available here: :ref:`CC-Apm-Structure`.
