Introduction
##############

NORTH (the NOMAD OASIS Remote Tools Hub) is a NOMAD OASIS service which makes
preconfigured scientific software of different communities available coupled
to the OASIS and accessible via the webbrowser. This part of the proposal documents
examples for specific NeXus-related work to some of the tools and containers
available in NORTH.

One tool is the paraprobe-toolbox software package in the the apm tools container.
The software is developed by `M. KÃ¼hbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_.

Here we show how NeXus is used to consistently define application definitions
for scientific software in the field of atom probe.

In this community the paraprobe-toolbox is an example of an open-source parallelized
software for analyzing point cloud data, for assessing meshes in 3D continuum
space, and analyzing the effects of parameterization on descriptors
about the microstructure of materials which were studied with atom probe microscopy.

The need for a thorough documentation of the tools in not only the paraprobe-toolbox
was motivated by several needs:

First, users of software would like to better understand and also be able to
study themselves which individual parameter and settings for each tool exists
and configuring these affects their analyses quantitatively.

Second, scientific software like those of the paraprobe-toolbox implement a
numerical workflow where multiple data sources and previous analysis results
are processed and carried through more involved analysis with several steps.

Individual tools are developed in C/C++ and/or Python. Here, having a possibility
for provenance tracking is useful as it is one component and requirement for
making workflows exactly numerically reproducible and thus to empower scientists
to fullfill better the "R", i.e. reproducibility of daily FAIR research practices.

The paraprobe-toolbox is one example of a software which implements a workflow
via a sequence of operations executed within a jupyter notebook
(or Python script respectively). Specifically, individual tools are chained
and convenience function are available to create well-defined input/configuration
files for each tool. These config files instruct the tool upon processing.

In this design, each workflow step (with a tool) is in fact a pair (or triple) of
at least two sub-steps: i) the creation of a configuration file, 
ii) the actual analysis using the Python/or C/C++ tools, 
iii) the optional of the results in the HDF5 file from each tool run with
other software in Python or Matlab for instance.

What has been achieved so far?
##############################

This proposal summarizes the first (of two) steps which change the interface and
file interaction in all tools of the paraprobe-toolbox to accept exclusively
well-defined configuration files and yield specific output.

Data and metadata between the tools are exchanged with HDF5/NeXus files.
Specifically, we created for each tool an application definition (see below)
which details all possible settings and options for the configuration as to
guide users. The config(uration) files are HDF5 files, whose content matches
to the naming conventions of the respective application definition for each tool.
As an example NXapm_paraprobe_config_surfacer specifies how a configuration file
for the paraprobe-surfacer tool should be formatted and which parameter it contains.

That is each config file uses a controlled vocabulary of terms. Furthermore,
the config files store a SHA256 checksum for each input file.
This implements a full provenance tracking on the input files along the
processing chain/workflow.

As an example, a user may first range their reconstruction and then compute
correlation functions. The config file for the ranging tool stores the files
which hold the reconstructed ion position and ranging definitions.
The ranging tool generates a results file with the ion type labels stored.

This results file and the reconstruction is imported by the spatial statistics
tool which again keeps track of all files. This makes it possible to rigorously
trace which numerical results were achieved with a specific chain of input and
settings using specifically-versioned tools.

We understand that this additional handling of metadata and provenance tracking
may not be at first glance super relevant for scientists or appear and unnecessary
feature. There is indeed an additional layer of work for the development
and maintenance of the software.

However, we are convinced that this is the preferred way of performing software
development and data analyses as it enables users to take advantage of a completely
automated provenance tracking which happens silently in the background.

New Base Classes
#################

We envision that the above-mentioned definitions can be useful not only to take
inspiration for other software tools in the field of atom probe but also to support
a discussion towards a stronger standardization of the vocabulary used.
Therefore, we are happy for your comments and suggestions on this and the related
pages via the hypothesis web annotation service.

We are convinced that the majority of data analyses in atom probe use
an in fact common set of operations and conditions on the input data
even though this might not be immediately evident. In particular this is not
the case for some community build tools with a very specific scope where oftentimes
the algorithms hardcoded. A typically example is a reseacher who implements a
ranging tool and uses that all the examples are on a specific material.
We are convinced it is better to follow a much more generalized approach.

In this spirit, we propose the following base classes as examples how very
flexible constraints can be implemented which restrict which ions in the dataset
should be processed or not. We see that these suggestion complement the
proposal on computational geometry base classes:

    :ref:`NXapm_input_reconstruction`:
        A description from which file the reconstructed ion positions are imported.

    :ref:`NXapm_input_ranging`:
        A description from which file the ranging definitions are imported.
        The design of the ranging definitions is, thanks to :ref:`NXion` so
        general that all possible nuclids be they observationally stable
        or radioactive can be considered.

A detailed inspection of spatial and other type of filters used in atom probe microscopy
data analysis revealed that it is better to define atom probe agnostic, i.e. more
general filters:

    :ref:`NXspatial_filter`:
        A proposal how a point cloud can be spatial filtered in a very specific,
        flexible, yet general manner. This base class takes advantage of
        :ref:`NXcg_ellipsoid_set`, :ref:`NXcg_cylinder_set`, and :ref:`NXcg_hexahedron_set`
        to cater for all of the most commonly used geometric primitives in
        atom probe.

    :ref:`NXsubsampling_filter`:
        A proposal for a filter that can also be used for specifying how entries
        like ions can be filtered via sub-sampling.

    :ref:`NXmatch_filter`:
        A proposal for a filter that can also be used for specifying how entries
        like ions can be filtered based on their type (ion species)
        or hit multiplicity.

In summary, we report with this proposal our experience made in an experimental
project that is about using NeXus for standardizing a certain scientific software.
During the implementation we learned that for handling computational geometry
and microstructure-related terms many subtilities have to be considered which
makes a controlled vocabulary valuable not only to avoid reimplementing the wheel.

This also makes us confident to take the next step which will be to change also
the results file of each tool. The following two application definition are
not yet implemented in the tools' source code but give an idea for development
purposes how such application definitions and description of created files could
look like.
