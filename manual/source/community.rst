NeXus Community

..  verbatim from the Introduction

NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a
common data storage format to exchange experimental results
and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them.

The :index:`NeXus Scientific Community <community>`
provides the scientific data, advice, and continued involvement
with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for the scientific
community to exchange ideas in data storage.

The NeXus International Advisory Committee (:index:`NIAC`) supervises the
development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
format for neutron, X-ray, and muon science
through the 
NeXus class definitions and oversees the maintenance of the
NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) as well as the technical infrastructure.

There are several mechanisms in place in order to coordinate the 
development of NeXus with the larger community.

NeXus Webpage
=============

First of all, there is the NeXus webpage,
https://www.nexusformat.org/,
which provides all kinds of information, including membership, minutes, and 
discussions from the meetings of the NIAC, Code Camps, and Tele Conferences, 
as well as some proposed designs for consideration by NeXus.

The webpage is kept with a number of other repositories in the nexusformat.org 
Github organisation https://github.com/nexusformat/.
As for all of these repositories, pull requests to correct or improve the content or 
code are always welcome!

Contributed Definitions
=======================

The community is encouraged to provide new definitions 
(:ref:`base.class.definitions` or :ref:`application.definitions`) for consideration
in the NeXus standard.  These community contributions
will be entered in the :ref:`contributed.definitions` 
and will be curated according to procedures set forth by the :ref:`NIAC`.
