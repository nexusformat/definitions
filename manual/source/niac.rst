================================================
NIAC: The NeXus International Advisory Committee
================================================

The purpose of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) [#]_ is to 
supervise the development and maintenance of the NeXus common data format
for neutron, X-ray, and muon science. This purpose includes, but is not limited to, the
following activities.

#. To establish policies concerning the definition, use, and promotion of the NeXus
   format.

#. To ensure that the specification of the NeXus format is sufficiently complete and
   clear for its use in the exchange and archival of neutron, X-ray, and muon
   data.

#. To receive and examine all proposed amendments and extensions to the NeXus format.
   In particular, to ratify proposed instrument and group class definitions, to ensure
   that the data structures conform to the basic NeXus specification, and to ensure
   that the definitions of data items (fields)
   are clear and unambiguous and conform to accepted
   scientific usage.
   
#. To ensure that documentation of the NeXus format is sufficient, current, and
   available to potential users both on the internet and in other forms.

#. To coordinate the maintenance of the NeXus Application Programming Interface
   and to promote other software development that will benefit users
   of the NeXus format.

#. To coordinate with other organizations that maintain and develop related data
   formats to reach compatibility.

The committee will meet at least once every other calendar year according to the following
plan:

- In years coinciding with the NOBUGS series of conferences (once every
  two years), members of the entire NIAC will meet as a satellite meeting to
  NOBUGS, along with interested members of the community.

- In intervening years, the executive officers of the NIAC will attend,
  along with interested members of the NIAC. This is intended to be a working
  meeting with a small group.
