Application Definitions
#######################

We realize that many experiments in condensed-matter physics and materials engineering belong to the category
of measurements of transparent phenomena. A possible example of such experiments are temperature-dependent
current-voltage (IV) curve measurements (or JV for engineers) measurements. In this case, electrical charge is transported
and the temperature-dependent current response as a function of applied voltage is recorded.

Below is an example for such an application definition for an experiment. This application definition has exemplar parts
which show how such an experiment can be controlled with the `EPICS system <https://epics-controls.org/about-epics/>`_:
