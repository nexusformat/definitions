Introduction
##############

Set of data storage objects to describe the acquisition/measurement side, the reconstruction, and the ranging for atom probe microscopy experiments. The data storage objects can be useful as well for field-ion microscopy experiments.

Application Definition
######################

It is proposed to use one application definition to serve atom probe tomography
and field-ion microscopy measurements, i.e. the data collection with the instrument:

    :ref:`NXapm`:
       A general application definition with many detailed places for leaving metadata and computational steps described which are commonly used when reporting the measurement of atom probe data including also detector hit data, as well as how to proceed with reconstructing atom positions from these data, and how to store details about definitions made, which describe how mass-to-charge-state ratio values are mapped to iontypes in a process called ranging.

Base Classes
############

The following base classes are proposed to support modularizing the storage of pieces of information:

    :ref:`NXchamber`:
        A base class to describe a component of the instrument which houses other components.
        A chamber may offer a controlled atmosphere to execute an experiment and/or offer functionalities for storing and loading specimens.

    :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`
        A base class to describe different coordinate systems used and/or to be harmonized
        or transformed into one another when interpreting the dataset.

    :ref:`NXion`:
       A base class to describe charged molecular ions with an adjustable number of atoms/isotopes building each ion. Right now the maximum number of atoms supported building a molecular ion
       is 32. Suggestions made in reference `DOI: 10.1017/S1431927621012241 <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_ are used to map isotope to hash values with
       which all possible isotopes can be described.

    :ref:`NXfabrication`:
        A base class to bundle manufacturer/technology-partner-specific details about a
        component or device of an instrument.

    :ref:`NXpeak`:
        A base class to describe peaks mathematically to detail how peaks in
        mass-to-charge-state ratio histograms (aka mass spectra) are
        defined and labelled as iontypes.

    :ref:`NXpump`:
        A base class to describe details about pump(s) of an instrument.

    :ref:`NXpulser_apm`:
        A base class to describe the high-voltage and/or laser pulsing capabilities of
        an atom probe microscope.

    :ref:`NXreflectron`:
        A base class to describe a kinetic-energy-sensitive filtering device
        for time of flight (ToF) mass spectrometry.

    :ref:`NXstage_lab`:
        A base class to describe the specimen fixture including the cryo-head.
        Nowadays, these stages represent small-scale laboratory platforms.
        Therefore, there is a need to define the characteristics of such stages in more detail,
        especially in light of in-situ experiments. Many similarities exists between a stage
        in an electron microscope and one in an atom probe instrument. Both offer fixture functionalities and additional components for applying e.g. stimuli on the specimen.

Microscopy experiments, not only taking into account those performed on commercial instruments, offer the user usually to apply a set of data processing steps. Some of them are frequently applied on-the-fly. For now we represent these steps with specifically named instances of the :ref:`NXprocess` base class.


Like every research community data processing steps are essential to transform measurements
into knowledge. These processing steps should be documented to enable reproducible research
and learn how pieces of information were connected. In what follows, an example is presented
how an open-source community software can be modified to use descriptions of these computational
steps. The respective research software here is the `paraprobe-toolbox <https://paraprobe-toolbox.readthedocs.io/>`_

.. _IntroductionApmParaprobe:

apmtools
########

One tool is the paraprobe-toolbox software package in the the apmtools container.
The software is developed by `M. KÃ¼hbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_.

Here we show how NeXus is used to consistently define application definitions for scientific software
in the field of atom probe. In this community the paraprobe-toolbox is an example of an
open-source parallelized software for analyzing point cloud data, for assessing meshes in
3D continuum space, and for studying the effects of parameterization on descriptors
which describe the micro- and nanostructure of materials that are studied with
atom probe microscopy.

The need for a thorough documentation of the tools in not only the paraprobe-toolbox
was motivated by several needs:

First, users of software would like to better understand and also be able to
study for themselves which individual parameters and settings for each tool exist
and how configuring these affects their analyses quantitatively.

Second, scientific software like the tools in the paraprobe-toolbox implement a
numerical/algorithmical (computational) workflow whereby data from multiple input sources
(like previous analysis results) are processed and carried through more involved analysis
within several steps inside the tool. The tool then creates output as files.

Individual tools of paraprobe-toolbox are developed in C/C++ and/or Python.
Provenance tracking is useful as it is one component and requirement for making
workflows exactly numerically reproducible and thereby empower scientists
to fulfill better the "R", i.e. reproducibility of their daily FAIR research practices.

The paraprobe-toolbox is one example of a software which implements a workflow
via a sequence of operations executed within a jupyter notebook
(or Python script respectively). Specifically, individual tools are chained.
Convenience functions are available to create well-defined input/configuration
files for each tool. These config files instruct the tool upon processing.

In this design, each workflow step (with a tool) is in fact a pair (or triple) of
at least two sub-steps: i) the creation of a configuration file, 
ii) the actual analysis using the Python/or C/C++ tools, 
iii) the optional post-processing/visualizing of the results inside the NeXus/HDF5
files generated from each tool run using other software.


.. _WhatHasBeenAchieved:

What has been achieved so far?
##############################

This proposal summarizes work of members of the FAIRmat project, which is part
of the German National Research Data Infrastructure aimed at a change of the paraprobe-toolbox
and its interaction with files for all tools so that only well-defined configuration files
are accepted as input and results end up as specifically formatted output. For this
NeXus application definitions are used.

Data and metadata between the tools are exchanged with NeXus/HDF5 files.
Specifically, we created for each tool an application definition (see below)
which details all possible settings and options for the configuration as to
guide users. The config(uration) files are currently implemented as HDF5 files,
whose content matches to the naming conventions of the respective `config` application
definition for each tool. As an example NXapm_paraprobe_config_surfacer specifies
how a configuration file for the paraprobe-surfacer tool should be formatted
and which parameter it should and/or may contain.

That is each config file uses a controlled vocabulary of terms. Furthermore,
the config files store a SHA256 checksum for each input file.
This implements a full provenance tracking on the input files along the
processing chain/workflow.

As an example, a user may first range their reconstruction and then compute
correlation functions. The config file for the ranging tool stores the files
which hold the reconstructed ion position and ranging definitions.
The ranging tool generates a results file with the ion type labels stored.
This results file is formatted according to the tool-specific `results`
application definition. This results file and the reconstruction is
imported by the spatial statistics tool which again keeps track of all files.

This design makes it possible to rigorously trace which numerical results
were achieved with a specific input and settings using specifically-versioned tools.

We understand that this additional handling of metadata and provenance tracking
may not be at first glance super relevant for scientists or appears to be an
unnecessarily complex feature. There is indeed an additional layer of work which
came with the development and maintenance of this functionality.

However, we are convinced that this is the preferred way of performing software
development and data analyses as it enables users to take advantage of a completely
automated provenance tracking which happens silently in the background.

Base Classes
############

We envision that the above-mentioned definitions can be useful not only to take
inspiration for other software tools in the field of atom probe but also to support
a discussion towards a stronger standardization of the vocabulary used.
Therefore, we are happy for comments and suggestions.

The majority of data analyses in atom probe use a common set of operations and
conditions on the input data even though this might not be immediately evident
or might not have been so explicitly communicated in the literature.
Some tools have a specific scope because of which algorithms are hardcoded
to work for specific material systems. A typical example is a ranging tool
which exploits that all the examples it is used for apply to a specific material
and thus specific iontypes can be hardcoded.

Instead, we are convinced it is better to follow a more generalized approach.
The following base classes and the above application definitions present examples
how one can use NeXus for this.

    :ref:`NXapm_input_reconstruction`:
        A description from which file the reconstructed ion positions are imported.

    :ref:`NXapm_input_ranging`:
        A description from which file the ranging definitions are imported.
        The design of the ranging definitions is, thanks to :ref:`NXion`, so
        general that all possible nuclids can be considered, be they observationally
        stable, be they radioactive or transuranium nuclids.

A detailed inspection of spatial and other type of filters frequently used in
analysis of atom probe data revealed that it is better to define atom-probe-agnostic,
i.e. more general filters:

    :ref:`NXspatial_filter`:
        A proposal how a point cloud can be spatially filtered in a specific yet general manner.
        This base class takes advantage of :ref:`NXcg_ellipsoid_set`, :ref:`NXcg_cylinder_set`,
        and :ref:`NXcg_hexahedron_set` to cater for all of the most commonly used
        geometric primitives in atom probe.

    :ref:`NXsubsampling_filter`:
        A proposal for a filter that can also be used for specifying how entries
        like ions can be filtered via sub-sampling.

    :ref:`NXmatch_filter`:
        A proposal for a filter that can also be used for specifying how entries
        like ions can be filtered based on their type (ion species)
        or hit multiplicity.
