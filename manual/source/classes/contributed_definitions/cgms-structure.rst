Introduction
############

The computational-geometry/microstructure-modeling-based part of the proposal
has the following aims:

First, we would like to contribute to efforts on standardizing a controlled
vocabulary, definitions for these terms, and relations between the terms, for
computational-geometry-based descriptions of the structure of materials and
atomic configurations used when characterizing materials in experiments
and computer simulations.

As far as NeXus is concerned, this proposed set of simple geometric primitives
and shapes offer a complementary alternative to the current set of base classes in
NeXus for constructive solid geometry such as :ref:`NXcsg`, :ref:`NXoff_geometry`, 
or :ref:`NXquadric` to name but a few.

Second, we would like to explore with this proposal how we can harmonize terms
frequently used by materials scientists in the field of condensed-matter physics
with definitions and terms offer by the NOMAD MetaInfo description.

Third, the proposal should yield a substantiated set of arguments and suggestions
how descriptors for the structure and atomic architecture of materials can be
harmonized. With this we especially would like to reach out and intensify the
cooperation between the materials-science-related consortia of the German
National Research Infrastructure, specifically, FAIRmat, NFDI-MatWerk, NFDI4Ing,
NFDI4Chem, NFDI4Cat, MaRDi, and DAPHNE.

.. The proposal reaches out to our colleagues in the materials engineering-based
.. consortia to document that there is value in discussing about controlled vocabulary.

Physics background
##################
Microstructural features or crystal defects are spatial arrangements of atoms.
Given their specific atomic arrangement and composition, such features have
specific constraints on the degrees of freedom how atoms can arrange. This causes
these defects to have specific properties.
Provided well-defined coarse-graining procedures are used and regions-of-interest
and/or regions-of-applicability are defined, microstructural features are often
characterized and modelled to have associated thermodynamic descriptors.

Another motivation for the proposal was the observation that frequently the design
of file formats for simulation software in the computational materials science especially
those tools at the interface between condensed-matter physics and materials engineering
are frequently reimplementing the wheel (at least partly) when it comes to decide how to store
e.g. atom and feature positions or shape of regions-of-interest, grids, crystals,
grains, precipitates, and dislocations.

Maybe this is a historical burden given the large set of technical terms and jargon
in place, which then motivated pragmatic solutions that resulted in many research groups
have developed similar formats using similar descriptions.

We see this work on base classes and application definitions not primarily an
effort to improve and extend NeXus for now. Rather this part of the proposal
is an effort to support activities in materials science to work towards
common terminology and using controlled vocabularies more frequently.
These are the foundation for more sophisticated thoughts about practically
useful ontologies.

Defining crystal defects is a question of how to coarse-grain a given spatiotemporal
set of atoms, each having a nuclide type and position/trajectory. Different mathematical/geometrical
methods exists to coarse-grain and thus determine how a point, a line, a surface, or
a volumetric defect can be described and be spatiotemporally constrained through
a geometrical model with defined geometric primitives and associated (materials)
properties at a coarser-scale.

The key motivation to such coarse-graining is to reduce the complexity of the
description. On the one hand to support visualization and scientific analyses - not only
of crystal defect arrangements. On the other hand it is the hope that using descriptors
at a coarser level, i.e. nanometre, micrometre, and larger, it is still possible
to find sufficiently accurate and precise descriptors that avoid one having to account
for the dynamics of each atom to predict or understand the properties of defects
and their dynamics.

Nevertheless, experience has shown that computational-geometry-based descriptions
when combined with hierarchical clustering/labeling methods, applied on set of
atoms and features turn out to yield useful descriptors. Examples include point,
line, surface defects, such as vacancies, solute cluster, dislocations,
disconnections, interfaces to name but a few.

############

The following base classes are defined to incentivize the use of NeXus for

Application definitions for ICME models
#######################################

It is important to embrace the large research community of materials engineers
as they are frequent users of electron microscopy and atom probe microscopy.
In this community frequently ICME (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering)
microstructure models are used. These models are derived from a design strategy
and workflow whereby physics-based modelling of microstructure evolution, typically
at the mesoscopic scale, is used to understand the relations between
the microstructure and technological relevant descriptors for the properties
of materials.

The following application definitions are proposed to support discussion on
how materials engineering-specific data models connect to or can be mapped on
concepts which are equally modellable with NeXus:

    :ref:`NXms`:
        An application definition for arbitrary spatiotemporally resolved simulations.

    :ref:`NXms_score_config`:
        A specific example of how :ref:`NXapm_paraprobe_config_ranger` can be
        specialized for documenting the configuration of a computer simulation
        with the static recrystallization cellular automata model SCORE.

    :ref:`NXms_score_results`:
        A specific example of how :ref:`NXms` can be specialized for documenting
        results of computer simulations with the static recrystallization
        cellular automata model SCORE.
