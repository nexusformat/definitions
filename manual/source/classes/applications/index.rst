Application Definitions
#########################

A description of each NeXus application definition is given.
NeXus application definitions define the *minimum*
set of terms that
*must* be used in an instance of that class.
Application definitions also may define terms that
are optional in the NeXus data file.  The definition, in this case,
reserves the exact term by declaring its spelling and description.
Consider an application definition as a *contract*
between a data provider (such as the beam line control system) and a 
data consumer (such as a data analysis program for a scientific technique)
that describes the information is certain to be available in a data file.

Use NeXus links liberally in data files to reduce duplication of data.
In application definitions involving raw data,
write the raw data in the :ref:`NXinstrument` tree and then link to it
from the location(s) defined in the relevant application definition.
    

:ref:`NXapm`
    Draft application definition for atom probe tomography and related field-ion microscopy, all summarized as atom probe microscopy experiments.
