Base Class Definitions
######################

A description of each NeXus base class definition is given.
NeXus base class definitions define the set of terms that
*might* be used in an instance of that class.
Consider the base classes as a set of *components*
that are used to construct a data file.
    

:ref:`NXaperture`
    A beamline aperture. This group is deprecated, use NXslit instead.
