These files are related to [issue #412](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/412), 
improving the NXdetector documentation.

Note:  `detectors.txt` (BTW: in reST format) is intended for 
inclusion into `design.rst` just before the `_Size-Shape` label:

```
.. include:: detectors.txt

..  
    .. _Size-Shape:
    
```
