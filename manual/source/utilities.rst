NeXus Utilities
===============

There are many utilities available to read, browse, write, and use NeXus data files. Some
are provided by the NeXus technical group while others are provided by the community. Still,
other tools listed here can read or write one of the low-level file formats used by NeXus (HDF5,
HDF4, or XML).

.. _Utilities-NeXus:

Utilities supplied with NeXus
#############################

.. index:: utilities
.. index:: programs
.. index:: software

Most of these utility programs are run from the command line. It will be noted if a
program provides a graphical user interface (GUI). Short descriptions are provided here with
links to further information, as available.

.. index:: 
        browser
	nxbrowse (utility)

**nxbrowse**
    NeXus Browser

.. index:: 
        conversion
	nxconvert (utility)

**nxconvert**
    Utility to convert a NeXus file into HDF4/HDF5/XML/...

.. index::
        inspection
	nxdir (utility)

**nxdir**
    ``nxdir`` is a utility for querying 
    a NeXus file about its contents. Full
    documentation can be found by running this command:
    
    .. code-block:: c
    
        nxdir -h

.. index::
        ingestion
	nxingest (utility)

**nxingest**
    ``nxingest`` extracts the metadata from a NeXus file to create an
    XML file according to a mapping file.  The mapping file defines the structure 
    :index:`(names and hierarchy) <hierarchy>` and content (from either the 
    NeXus file, the mapping file or the current time) of the output file. See
    the man page for a description of the mapping file.  This tool uses the  
    :index:`NAPI`.  Thus, any of the supported formats (HDF4, HDF5 and XML)
    can be read.

.. index:: 
	nxsummary 

**nxsummary**
    Use ``nxsummary`` to generate summary of a NeXus file.
    This program relies heavily on a configuration file. Each ``item`` tag
    in the file describes a node to print from the NeXus file. The ``path``
    attribute describes where in the NeXus file to get information from. The
    ``label`` attribute will be printed when showing the value of the
    specified field. The optional ``operation`` attribute provides for certain
    operations to be performed on the data before printing out the result.
    See the source code documentation for more details.

.. index::
	nxtranslate (utility)

**nxtranslate**
    ``nxtranslate`` is
    an anything to NeXus converter. This is accomplished by
    using translation files and a plugin style of architecture where
    ``nxtranslate`` can read from new formats as plugins become available. The
    documentation for ``nxtranslate`` describes its usage by three types of
    individuals:
    
    + the person using existing translation files to create NeXus files
    + the person creating translation files
    + the person writing new *retrievers*
    
    All of these concepts are discussed in detail in the documentation
    provided with the source code.


.. index:: 
   plotting
	NXplot (utility)

**NXplot**
    An extendable utility for plotting any NeXus file.  ``NXplot`` is
    an Eclipse-based GUI project in Java to plot data in NeXus files. (The project was
    started at the first NeXus Code Camp in 2009.)

Validation
##########

The list of applications below are for :ref:`validating <Verification>` NeXus files. 
The list is not intended to be a complete list of all available packages.

.. index::
   validation
   file; validate
   nxvalidate (utility)

.. _nxvalidate:

   *"This is the first version of nxvalidate written in C. 
   Its dependencies are libxml2 and the HDF5 libraries, 
   version 1.8.9 or better. Its purpose is to validate HDF5 
   data files against NeXus application definitions."*
    
   Note: this tool is lives in its own GitHub repository **cnxvalidate**:
   https://github.com/nexusformat/cnxvalidate.git

.. index::
        validation
   file; validate
   punx (utility)

.. _punx:

**punx**
   Python Utilities for NeXus HDF5 files
   
   **punx** can validate
   both NXDL files and NeXus HDF5 data files, as well as print
   the structure of any HDF5 file, even non-NeXus files.
    
   NOTE: project is under initial construction, 
   not yet released for public use, but is useful in its 
   present form (version 0.0.9).  
    
   See the program documentation for more details:
