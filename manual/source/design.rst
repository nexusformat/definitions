NeXus Design
============

This chapter actually defines the rules to use for writing valid NeXus files. An explanation of NeXus objects
is followed by the definition of NeXus coordinate systems, the rules for structuring files and the rules for
storing single items of data.

The structure of NeXus files is extremely flexible, allowing the storage both of
simple data sets, such as a single data array and its axes, and also of highly complex
data, such as the simulation results or an entire multi-component instrument. This flexibility
is a necessity as NeXus strives to capture data from a wild variety of applications in X-ray, muSR and
neutron scattering. The flexibility is achieved through a :index:`hierarchical <hierarchy>`
structure, with related *fields* collected together into *groups*,
making NeXus files easy to navigate, even without any
documentation. NeXus files are self-describing, and should be easy to understand, at
least by those familiar with the experimental technique.


.. _Design-Objects:

NeXus Objects and Terms
#######################

Before discussing the design of NeXus in greater detail it is necessary to define the objects and terms
used by NeXus. These are:

:ref:`Design-Groups`
    Levels in the NeXus hierarchy. May contain fields and other groups.

:ref:`Design-Fields`
    Multidimensional arrays and scalars representing the actual data to be stored

:ref:`Design-Attributes`
    Attributes containing additional metadata can be assigned to groups, fields,
    or :ref:`files <Design-FileAttributes>`.

:ref:`Design-Links`
    Elements which point to data stored in another place in the file hierarchy

:ref:`Design-NeXusClasses`
    Dictionaries of names possible in the various types of NeXus groups

:ref:`Design-NeXusApplications`
    Describe the minimum content of a NeXus file for a particular usage case

In the following sections these elements of NeXus files will be defined in more detail.

.. _tree.structure:

.. note:: Notation used to describe a NeXus data file

   In various places in the NeXus manual, contents of a NeXus
   data file are described using a tree structure, such as
   in the :ref:`Introduction<fig.verysimple-structure>`.

   The tree syntax is a very condensed version (with high information density) meant to convey the structure of the HDF file.

   * Groups have a ``/`` appended to their name (with NeXus class name shown)
   * Indentation shows membership in the lesser indented parent above.
   * Fields have a data type and value appended (for arrays, this may be an abbreviated view)
   * Attributes (of groups or fields) are prefixed with ``@``.
   * NeXus-style links are described with some sort of arrow notation such as ``-->``.


.. index::
   ! single: group
   see: data group; group
   see: folder; group

.. _Design-Groups:

Groups
======

NeXus files consist of data groups,
which contain fields and/or other
groups to form a :index:`hierarchical structure <hierarchy>`.
This hierarchy is designed to make it
easy to navigate a NeXus file by storing related fields together. Data
groups are identified both by a name, which must be unique within a particular
group, and a class. There can be multiple groups with the same class
but they must have different names (based on the :index:`HDF rules <rules; HDF>`).

For the class names used with NeXus data groups the prefix NX is reserved. Thus all NeXus class
names start with NX.

    .. index::
      ! single: field
      see:    SDS (Scientific Data Sets); field
      see:    Scientific Data Sets; field
      see:    data field; field
      see:    data item; field
      see:    data object; field
      see:    data set; field
      see:    dataset; field

.. _Design-Fields:

Fields
======

Fields (also called data fields, data items or data sets)
contain the essential information stored in a NeXus file. They can
be scalar values or multidimensional arrays of a variety of sizes (1-byte,
2-byte, 4-byte, 8-byte) and types (integers, floats, characters). The fields may
store both experimental results (counts, detector angles, etc), and other
information associated with the experiment (start and end times, user names,
etc). Fields are identified by their names, which must be unique within the
group in which they are stored.  Some fields have engineering units to be specified.
In some cases, such in ``NXdetector/data``, a field is expected to have be
an array of several dimensions.

	.. compound::

		.. changed from table since sphinx PDF table columns were not sized correctly

		.. rubric::  Examples of fields

		``variable`` (*NX_NUMBER*)
			Dimension scale defining an axis of the data.

		``variable_errors`` (*NX_NUMBER*)
			Errors (uncertainties) associated with axis ``variable``.

		``wavelength`` (*NX_FLOAT*)
			wavelength of radiation, ``units="NX_FLOAT"``

		``chemical_formula`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			The chemical formula specified using CIF conventions.

		``name`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			Name of user responsible for this entry.

		``data`` (*NX_NUMBER*)
			Data values from the detector, ``units="NX_ANY"``

In the case of streaming data acquisition, when time stamped values of data are collected, fields can be replaced with :ref:`NXlog` structures of 
the same name. For example, if time stamped data for wavelength is being streamed, wavelength would not be an array but a :ref:`NXlog` structure.

.. _Design-Attributes:

Attributes
==========

Attributes are extra (meta-)information that are associated with particular
groups or fields. They are used to annotate data, e.g. with physical
:index:`units` or calibration offsets, and may be scalar numbers or character
strings. In addition, NeXus uses attributes to identify
:index:`plottable data <plotting>`
and their axes, etc. In a :ref:`tree structure<tree.structure>`,
an attribute is usually shown with a ``@`` prefix, such as ``@units``.
A description of some of the many possible
attributes can be found in the next table:

	.. compound::

		.. rubric::  Examples of attributes

		``units`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			:index:`Data units <units>` given as character strings,
			must conform to the NeXus units standard.   See the
			:ref:`Design-Units` section for details.

		``signal`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			Defines which data set contains the signal
			to be :index:`plotted <plotting>`.
			Use ``signal="{dataset_name}"`` where ``{dataset_name}``
			is the name of a field (or link to a field) in the :ref:`NXdata` group.
			The field referred to by the *signal* attribute
			might be referred to as the ":index:`signal data`".

		``long_name`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			Defines title of signal data or axis label of dimension scale

		``calibration_status`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			Defines	status of data value - set to ``Nominal`` or ``Measured``

		``data_offset`` (*NX_INT*)
			Rank values of offsets to use for each
			:index:`dimension <dimension>`
			if the data is not in C storage order

		``interpretation`` (*NX_CHAR*)
			Describes how to display the data.
			``rgba``, ``hsla`` and ``cmyk`` are (`n x m x 4`) arrays, where the
			4 channels are the colour channels appropriately. If the image data
			does not contain an alpha channel, then the array should simply be
			(`n x m x 3`).
			Allowed values include:

			* ``scalar`` (0-D data)
			* ``scaler`` DEPRECATED, use ``scalar``
			* ``spectrum`` (1-D data)
			* ``image`` (2-D data)
			* ``rgb-image`` (3-D data)
			* ``rgba-image`` (3-D data)
			* ``hsl-image`` (3-D data)
			* ``hsla-image`` (3-D data)
			* ``cmyk-image`` (3-D data)
			* ``vertex`` (3-D data)

File attributes
===============

Finally, some attributes are defined at file level.
They are specified in the base class :ref:`NXroot`.


.. _Design-Links:

Links
=====

.. index::
   ! single: link target (internal attribute)

.. sidebar:: Python h5py code to make NeXus links

   The section titled :ref:`Example-H5py` provides example
   python code to create links (both internal and external)
   in NeXus data files.  See the routines:

   * **{hdf5_object}._id.link()**
   * **h5py.ExternalLink()**

Links are pointers to existing data somewhere else.
The concept is very much like
symbolic links in a unix filesystem.
The NeXus definition sometimes requires to
have access to the same data in different groups
in the same file. For example: detector data is stored in the
``NXinstrument/NXdetector`` group
but may be needed in ``NXdata`` for automatic plotting.
Rather then replicating the data, NeXus uses
links in such situations. See the :ref:`figure <fig.data-linking>` for
a more descriptive representation of the concept of linking.

        Linking in a NeXus file

.. index::
   ! single: target, attribute
   single: link, target, attribute
   single: address, absolute
   single: address, relative
   ! link, NeXus link
   ! NeXus link

NeXus links are HDF5 hard links with an additional ``target`` attribute.
The ``target`` attribute is added [#]_ for NeXus to distinguish the HDF5 path to the
*original* [#]_ dataset.  The value of the ``target`` attribute is the HDF5
path [#absolute_address]_ to the *original* dataset.

   .. [#] When using the NAPI, the ``target`` attribute is added automatically.
      When the NAPI is not used to write NeXus/HDF5 files, this attribute must
      be added.  Here are the steps to follow:

      #. Get the HDF5 reference ID of the source item (*field*, *group*, or *link*) to be linked.
      #. If the ID does not have a ``target`` attribute defined:
         #. Get the absolute HDF5 address [#absolute_address]_ of the ID.
         #. Create a ``target`` attribute for the ID.
         #. Set the ``target`` attribute's value to the absolute HDF5 address of the ID.
      #. Create an HDF5 hard link [#hdf5_hard_link]_
         to the ID at the desired (new) HDF5 address.

   .. [#] The notion of an *original* dataset with regard to links is
      a NeXus abstraction.  In truth, HDF5 makes no distinction which is
      the *original* dataset.  But, when the file is viewed with a tool
      such as *h5dump*, confusion often occurs over which dataset is
      original and which is a link to the original.  Actually, both HDF5 paths
      point to the exact, same dataset which exists at a specific offset in the HDF5 file.

      See the :ref:`FAQ` question: **I'm using links to place data in two places.
      Which one should be the data and which one is the link?**

   .. [#absolute_address] When using the ``target`` attribute,
      **always** specify the HDF5 address
      as an *absolute** address (starts from the HDF5 root,
      such as: ``/entry/instrument/detector/polar_angle``)
      rather than a **relative** address (starting from the current group,
      such as: ``detector/polar_angle``).

      .. note:: The ``target`` attribute does not work for
         :ref:`external file links<design.external_file_link>`.
         The NIAC is working at resolving the technical limitations

   .. [#hdf5_hard_link] HDF5 hard link:
      https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5L_CREATE_HARD

.. index:: !class path

NeXus links are best understood with an example.
The canonical location (expressed as a NeXus class path) to store wavelength
(see :ref:`Strategies-wavelength`) has been::

    /NXentry/NXinstrument/NXcrystal/wavelength

An alternative location for this field makes sense to many,
especially those not using a crystal to create monochromatic radiation::

    /NXentry/NXinstrument/NXmonochromator/wavelength

These two fields might be hard linked together in a NeXus data file
(using HDF5 paths such ``/entry/instrument``)::

    entry:NXentry
        ...
        instrument:NXinstrument
            ...
            crystal:NXcrystal
                ...
                wavelength:NX_FLOAT = 154.
                    @target="/entry/instrument/crystal/wavelength"
                    @units="pm"
            ...
            monochromator:NXmonochromator
                ...
                wavelength --> "/entry/instrument/crystal/wavelength"

It is possible that the linked field or group has a
different name than the original.  One obvious use of this capability
is to adapt to a specific requirement of an application definition.
For example, suppose some application definition required the
specification of wavelength as a field named *lambda* in the entry group.
This requirement can be satisifed easily::

    entry:NXentry
        ...
        instrument:NXinstrument
            ...
            crystal:NXcrystal
                ...
                wavelength:NX_FLOAT = 154.
                    @target="/entry/instrument/crystal/wavelength"
                    @units="pm"
            ...
            monochromator:NXmonochromator
                ...
                wavelength --> "/entry/instrument/crystal/wavelength"
        ...
        lambda --> "/entry/instrument/crystal/wavelength"

.. _design.external_file_link:

.. index:: link; external file

External File Links
-------------------

NeXus also allows for links to external files.
Consider the case where an instrument uses a detector with
a closed-system software support provided by a commercial vendor.
This system writes its images into a NeXus HDF5 file.
The instrument's data acquisition system writes instrument metadata
into another NeXus HDF5 file.  In this case, the instrument metadata file
might link to the data in the detector image file.
Here is an example (from Diamond Light Source)
showing an external file link in HDF5:

	.. compound::

		.. rubric:: Example of linking to data in an external HDF5 file

		.. code-block:: text
			:linenos:

			 EXTERNAL_LINK "data" {
				TARGETFILE "/dls/i22/data/2012/sm7594-1/i22-69201-Pilatus2M.h5"
				TARGETPATH "entry/instrument/detector/data"
			 }

.. note:: The NAPI code [#]_ makes no ``target`` attribute assignment for
   links to external files.  It is best to avoid using the
   ``target`` attribute with external file links.
   The NIAC is working at resolving the technical limitations

   .. Q: So what happens if the object in the external file
      has a ``@target`` attribute?

   .. [#] ``NX5nativeexternallink()``:
      https://github.com/nexusformat/code/blob/fe8ddd287ee33961982931e2016cc25f76f95edd/src/napi5.c#L2248

The NAPI maintains a group attribute ``@napimount`` that provides
a URL to a group in another file.  More information about the
``@napimount`` attribute is described in the
*NeXus Programmers Reference*. [#]_

.. [#] https://manual.nexusformat.org/pdf/NeXusIntern.pdf

.. index:: link; external file, NeXus link

Combining NeXus links and External File Links
---------------------------------------------

Consider the case described in
:ref:`Links to Data in External HDF5 Files <h5py-example-external-links>`,
where numerical data are provided in two different HDF5 files and a *master* NeXus HDF5 file links to
the data through external file links.  HDF5 will not allow hard links to be constructed with these data
objects in the master file.  An error such as *Interfile hard links are not allowed* (as generated
from h5py) will arise.  This makes sense since there is no such data object in the file.

Instead, it is necessary to make an external file link at each place in the master where external
data is to be represented.

.. _Design-NeXusClasses:

NeXus Base Classes
==================

.. index:: NX; used as NX class prefix
.. index:: rules; NX prefix

Data groups often describe objects in the experiment (monitors, detectors,
monochromators, etc.), so that the contents (both fields and/or other
groups) comprise the properties of that object. NeXus has defined a set of standard
objects, or :ref:`base classes <base.class.definitions>`,
out of which a NeXus file can be constructed. This is each data group
is identified by a name and a class. The group class, defines the type of object
and the properties that it can contain, whereas the group name defines a unique instance
of that class. These classes are
defined in XML using the NeXus Definition Language
:index:`(NXDL) <NXDL>` format. All NeXus class types adopted by the NIAC *must*
begin :index:`with <rules; naming>` ``NX``.
Classes not adopted by the NIAC *must not*
start with ``NX``.

.. note:: NeXus base classes are the components used to build the
          NeXus data structure.

Not all classes define physical objects. Some refer to logical groupings of
experimental information, such as
:index:`plottable data <plotting>`,
sample environment logs, beam profiles, etc.
There can be multiple instances of each class. On
the other hand, a typical NeXus file will only contain a small subset of the
possible classes.

.. note::
	The groups, fields, links, and attributes of a base class
	definition are all **optional**, with a few particular exceptions in
	``NXentry`` and ``NXdata``.  They are named in the specification
	to describe the exact spelling and usage of the term when it appears.

NeXus base classes are not proper classes in the same sense as used in object oriented programming
languages. In fact the use of the term classes is actually misleading but has established itself during the
development of NeXus. NeXus base classes are rather dictionaries of field names and their meanings
which are permitted in a particular NeXus group implementing the NeXus class. This sounds complicated but
becomes easy if you consider that most NeXus groups describe instrument components. Then for example, a
NXmonochromator base class describes all the possible field names which NeXus allows to be used to describe a
monochromator.

Most NeXus base classes represent instrument components. Some are used as containers to structure information in a
file (``NXentry``, ``NXcollection``, ``NXinstrument``, ``NXprocess``, ``NXparameters``).
But there are some base classes which have special uses which need to be mentioned here:

:ref:`NXdata`
    ``NXdata`` is used to identify the default
    :index:`plottable data <plotting>`.
    The notion of a default plot of data is a basic motivation of NeXus.
    (see :ref:`SimplePlotting`)

:ref:`NXlog`
    ``NXlog`` is used to store time stamped data like the log of a temperature controller.
    Basically you give a start time,
    and arrays with a difference in seconds to the start time and the values read.

:ref:`NXcollection`
   ``NXcollection`` is used to gather together any set of terms.
   Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
   an ``NXcollection`` group will not be validated.
   One use is to use this as a container class for the various
   control system variables from a beamline or instrument.

:ref:`NXnote`
   This group provides a place to store general notes, images, video or
   whatever.  A mime type is stored together with a binary blob of data.
   Please use this only for auxiliary information, for example an image
   of your sample, or a photo of your boss.

:ref:`NXtransformations`
    ``NXtransformations`` is used to gather together any set of movable or fixed
      elements positioning the device described by the class that contains this.
      Supercedes ``NXgeometry``.

:ref:`NXgeometry` (superceded by :ref:`NXtransformations`, [#]_)
    ``NXgeometry`` and its subgroups ``NXtranslation``,
    ``NXorientation``, ``NXshape`` are  used to store absolute positions in the
    laboratory coordinate system or to define shapes.

   .. [#] see: https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/397

These groups can appear anywhere in the NeXus hierarchy, where needed. Preferably close to the component they
annotate or in a ``NXcollection``. All of the base classes are documented in the reference manual.

.. _NXdata-facilitates-TheDefaultPlot:

``NXdata`` Facilitates Automatic Plotting
-----------------------------------------

.. index::
   ! single: plotting
   single: motivation
   see: automatic plotting; plotting
   see: default plot; plotting
   single: dimension scale

The most notable special base class (or *group* in NeXus) is ``NXdata``.
``NXdata`` is the answer to a basic motivation of NeXus to facilitate
automatic plotting of data.
``NXdata`` is designed to contain the main dataset and its associated
dimension scales (axes) of a NeXus data file.
The usage scenario is that an automatic data plotting program just
opens a ``NXentry`` and then continues to search for any ``NXdata``
groups. These ``NXdata`` groups represent the plottable data.
An algorithm for identifying the default plottable data
is :ref:`presented <Find-Plottable-Data>` in the
chapter titled :ref:`DataRules`.



.. the previous description
	Here is the way an automatic plotting program ought to work:

	#. Search for ``NXentry`` groups

	#. Open an ``NXentry``

	#. Search for ``NXdata`` groups

	#. Open an ``NXdata`` group

	#. Identify the plottable data.

	   #. Search for a dataset with attribute ``signal=1``. This is your main dataset.
		  (There should be *only one* dataset that matches.)

	   #. Try to read the ``axes`` attribute of the main dataset, if it exists.

		  #. The value of ``axes`` is a colon- or comma-separated list of the datasets describing the
			 :index:`dimension scales <dimension scale>`
			 (such as ``axes="polar_angle:time_of_flight"``).

		  #. Parse ``axes`` and open the datasets to describe your
			 :index:`dimension scales <dimension scale>`

	   #. If ``axes`` does not exist:

		  #. Search for datasets with attributes ``axis=1``, ``axis=2``, etc.
			 These are the datasets describing your axis. There may be
			 several datasets for any axis, i.e. there may be multiple datasets with the attribute ``axis=1``. Among them the dataset with the
			 attribute ``primary=1`` is the preferred one. All others are alternative :index:`dimension scales <dimension scale>`.

		  #. Open the datasets to describe your dimension scales.

	#. Having found the default plottable data and
	   its :index:`dimension scales <dimension scale>`:
	   make the plot.


.. _where.to.store.metadata:

Where to Store Metadata
-----------------------

.. index:: ! metadata

There are many ways to store metadata about your experiments.
Already there are many fields in the various base classes
to store the more common or general metadata, such as wavelength.
(For wavelength, see the :ref:`Strategies-wavelength` section.)

One common scheme is to store the metadata all in one
group.  If the group is to be validated for content,
then there are several possibilities, as shown in the next table:

==========================  ===========================================
base class                  intent
==========================  ===========================================
:ref:`NXnote`               to store additional information
:ref:`NXlog`                information that is time-stamped
:ref:`NXparameters`         parameters for processing or analysis
:ref:`NXcollection`         to store *any* unvalidated content
==========================  ===========================================

If the content of the metadata group is to be excluded from validation,
then store it in a :ref:`NXcollection` group.



.. _Design-NeXusApplications:

NeXus Application Definitions
=============================

The objects described so far provide us with the means to store data from a wide variety of instruments,
simulations, or processed data as resulting from data analysis. But NeXus strives to express strict standards for
certain applications of NeXus, too. The tool which NeXus uses for the expression of such strict standards is the NeXus
:ref:`Application Definition <application.definitions>`.
A NeXus Application Definition describes which groups and data items have to be present in
a file in order to properly describe an application of NeXus. For example for describing  a powder diffraction
experiment.
An application definition may also declare terms which are optional in the data file.
Typically an application definition will contain only a small subset of the many groups and fields
defined in NeXus. NeXus application definitions are also expressed in the NeXus Definition Language (NXDL). A tool exists
which allows one to validate a NeXus file against a given application definition.

.. note:: NeXus application definitions define the *minimum required* information
          necessary to satisfy data analysis or other data processing.

Another way to look at a NeXus application definition is as a
contract between a file producer (writer) and a file consumer (reader).

	The contract reads:
	*If you write your files following a particular NeXus application definition,
	I can process these files with my software.*

Yet another way to look at a NeXus application definition is to understand it as an interface definition
between data files and the software which uses this file. Much like an interface in the Java or other modern
object oriented programming languages.

In contrast to NeXus base classes, NeXus supports inheritance in application definitions.

Please note that a NeXus Application Definition will only define the bare minimum of data necessary to perform
common analysis with data. Practical files will nearly always contain more data. One of the beauties of NeXus is
that it is always possible to add more data to a file without breaking its compliance with its application definition.

NeXus supports description of the shape, position and orientation of objects in
:ref:`Design-CoordinateSystem`. Position and
orientation can be defined as :ref:`CoordinateTransformations` using the
:ref:`NXtransformations` class. :ref:`ShapeDescriptions` use the :ref:`NXoff_geometry`

You may come across old files which use :ref:`LegacyGeometryDescriptions`.

it is the same as that used by *McStas* (http://mcstas.org). This choice is
arbitrary and any other choice should be possible as long as it is
used consistently and application code that reads NeXus files does not assume
any prior knowledge of the chosen coordinate system.

.. _CoordinateTransformations:

Coordinate Transformations
==========================

.. index:: transformation matrices

In the recommended way of dealing with geometry NeXus uses a series of
:index:`transformations <coordinate systems; transformations>` to place objects in space.
In this world view, the absolute position of a component or a detector pixel with respect to
the laboratory coordinate system is calculated by applying a series of translations and
rotations. Thus a rotation or translation operation transforms the whole coordinate system
and gives rise to a new local coordinate system. These transformations between coordinate
systems are mathematical operations and can be expressed as matrices and their combination
as matrix multiplication. A very important aspect is that the order of application of the
individual operations *does* matter. The mathematics behind this is well known and used in
such applications such as industrial robot control, flight dynamics and
computer games. The beauty in this comes from the fact that the operations to apply map easily
to instrument settings and constants. It is also easy to analyze the contribution of each individual
operation: this can be studied under the condition that all other operations are at a zero setting.

In order to use coordinate transformations, several pieces of information need to be known:

    **Type**
        The type of operation: rotation or translation

    **Direction**
        The direction of the translation or the direction of the rotation axis

    **Value**
        The angle of rotation or the length of the translation

    **Order**
        The order of operations to apply to move a component into its place.


Coordinate Transformation Field And Attributes
----------------------------------------------

NeXus chooses to encode information about each transformation as a field in an ``NXtransformations``
group in the following way:

  .. index::
     ! single: value (transformation matrix)
     ! single: offset (field attribute)

  ``value``
     This is represented in the actual data of the field or the **value** of the
     transformation. Its actual name should relate to the physical device used to
     effect the transformation.

     The coordinate transformation attributes are:

       .. index::
         single: transformation type (field attribute)
         single: translation
         single: rotation

       ``transformation_type``
         This specifies the **type** of transformation and is either *rotation*
         or *translation* and describes the kind of operation performed

       .. index::
         single: vector (field attribute)
         see: direction; vector (field attribute)

       ``vector`` (*NX_NUMBER*)
        This is a set of 3 values forming a unit vector for **direction** that
        describes the components of either the direction of the rotation axis or
        the direction along which the translation happens.

       .. index::
         ! single: offset (field attribute)

       ``offset`` (*NX_NUMBER*)
         This is a set of 3 values forming the offset vector for a translation to apply
         before applying the operation of the actual transformation. Without this offset
         attribute, additional virtual translations would need to be introduced in order
         to encode mechanical offsets in the axis.

       .. index::
         see: order (transformation); depends on (field attribute)
         ! single: depends on (field attribute)

       ``depends_on``
    	 The **order** is encoded through this attribute. The value is the name of the
         transformation upon which the current transformation depends on.

         As each transformation represents possible motion by a physical device, this
         dependency expresses the attachment order; thus, the current device is attached
         to (or mounted on) the next device referred to by the attribute.

         Allowed values for depends_on are:

           ``.``
             A dot ends the depends_on chain
           ``name``
             The name of a field within the enclosing group
           ``dir/name``
             The name of a field further along the path
           ``/dir/dir/name``
             An absolute path to a field in another group

    	 In addition, for each beamline component, there is a ``depends_on`` attribute
         that points to the field at the head of the axis dependency chain. For example,
         consider an :index:`eulerian cradle` as used on a :index:`four-circle diffractometer`.
         Such a cradle has a dependency chain of ``phi:chi:rotation_angle``. Then
    	 the ``depends_on`` field in :ref:`NXsample` would have the value ``phi``.

The type and direction of the NeXus standard operations is documented below
in the table: :ref:`Actions of standard NeXus fields<tb.table-transform>`.
The rule is to always give the attributes to make perfectly clear how the axes work. The :index:`CIF` scheme
also allows to store and use arbitrarily named axes in a NeXus file.

The CIF scheme (see :ref:`NXtransformations`) is the preferred method
for expressing geometry in NeXus.

For the NeXus spherical coordinate system (described in the legacy section below), the order is implicit and is given in the next example.

		    azimuthal_angle:polar_angle:distance

This is also a nice example of the application of transformation matrices:

#. You first apply ``azimuthal_angle`` as a rotation
   around *z*.  This rotates the whole coordinate out of the plane.

#. Then you apply ``polar_angle`` as a rotation around
   *y* in the tilted coordinate system.

#. This also moves the direction of the *z* vector.
   Along which you translate the component to place by distance.

.. _ShapeDescriptions:

Shape Descriptions
==================

``NXoff_geometry``
------------------

The shape of instrument components can be described using the :ref:`NXoff_geometry`
class. ``NXoff_geometry`` is a polygon-based description, based on the open OFF format.
Conversion between OFF files and the NeXus description is straightforward. This is
beneficial as existing tools can use, view or manipulate the geometry in OFF files.
CAD software, for example `FreeCAD <https://www.freecadweb.org/>`_, can be used to
define the geometry. 3D rendering tools such as `Geomview <http://www.geomview.org/>`_
can be used to view the geometry. `McStas <http://www.mcstas.org/>`_ can use OFF
files to define the shape of components for scattering simulations.

The example OFF file shown below defines a cube. The first line containing
numbers defines: the number of vertices, the number of faces (polygons) making
up the model's surface, and the number of edges in the mesh. Note, the number of
edges must be present but does not need to be correct
(http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/OFF.html).

.. literalinclude:: examples/cube.off
   :tab-width: 4
   :linenos:
   :language: text

Following the initial line are the xyz coordinates of each vertex. Proceeding
which is the list of faces. Each line defining a face starts with the number of
vertices in that face followed by the sequence number of the composing vertices,
indexed from zero. The vertex indices form a winding order by defining the face
normal by the right-hand rule. The number of vertices in each face need not be
constant; a mesh can comprise of polygons of many different orders.

The list of vertices in an OFF file maps directly to the ``vertices`` dataset in
the :ref:`NXoff_geometry` class. The vertex indices of the face list in the OFF
file occupy the ``winding_order`` dataset of the NeXus class, however the list
is flattened to 1D in order to avoid a ragged-edged dataset, which are not
easy to work with using HDF libraries. A ``faces`` dataset contains the position
of the first entry in ``winding_order`` for each face. The ``NXoff_geometry``
equivalent of the OFF cube example is shown below.

.. literalinclude:: examples/cube_NXoff_geometry.txt
   :tab-width: 4
   :linenos:
   :language: text

``NXcylindrical_geometry``
--------------------------

Although the polygon-based description of :ref:`NXoff_geometry` is very flexible,
it is not ideal for curved shapes when high precision is required since a very
large number of vertices may be necessary. A common example of this is when
describing helium tube, neutron detectors. :ref:`NXcylindrical_geometry` provides
a more concise method of defining shape for such cases.

Like ``NXoff_geometry``, ``NXcylindrical_geometry`` contains a ``vertices``
dataset. The indices of three vertices (**A**, **B**, **C** in :ref:`fig.cylinder_3_points`) in the ``vertices`` dataset are used to
define each cylinder in the ``cylinders`` dataset.

        Cylinder definition with three vertices


Detector Shape Descriptions
---------------------------

An ``NXoff_geometry`` or ``NXcylindrical_geometry`` group named ``detector_shape``
can be placed in an ``NXdetector`` or ``NXdetector_module`` to define the complete
shape of the detector. Alternatively, the group can be named ``pixel_shape``
and define the shape of a single pixel. In this case, ``x_pixel_offset``,
``y_pixel_offset`` and ``z_pixel_offset`` datasets of the ``NXdetector`` define
how the pixel shape is tiled to form the geometry of the complete detector.

.. _LegacyGeometryDescriptions:

Legacy Geometry Descriptions
============================

The above system of chained transformations is the recommended way of
encoding geometry going forward. This section describes the traditional way
this was handled in NeXus, which you may find occasionally in old files.


:index:`Coordinate systems <coordinate systems>`
in NeXus have undergone significant development. Initially, only motor
positions of the relevant motors were stored without further standardization.
This soon proved to be
too little and the *NeXus polar coordinate* system
:index:`was <coordinate systems; NeXus polar coordinate>`
developed. This system still
is very close to angles that are meaningful to an instrument scientist
but allows to define general positions of
components easily. Then users from the simulation community
approached the NeXus team and asked for a means
to store absolute coordinates. This was implemented through
the use of the *NXgeometry* class on top of the
*McStas* :index:`system <coordinate systems; McStas>`.
We soon learned that all the things we do can be expressed through the
McStas coordinate system. So it became the reference coordinate system
for NeXus. ``NXgeometry`` was expanded to allow the description of shapes
when the demand came up. Later, members of the
:index:`CIF <coordinate systems; CIF>` team
convinced the NeXus team of the beauty of transformation matrices and
NeXus was enhanced to store the necessary information to fully map CIF
concepts. Not much had to be changed though as we
choose to document the existing angles in CIF terms. The CIF system
allows to store arbitrary operations and nevertheless calculate
absolute coordinates in the laboratory coordinate system. It also
allows to convert from local, for example detector
coordinate systems, to absolute coordinates in the laboratory system.

.. _Design-Coordinate-NXgeometry:

McStas and ``NXgeometry`` System
--------------------------------

.. index::
    geometry
    coordinate systems; McStas
    McStas

As stated above, NeXus uses the
*McStas coordinate system* (http://mcstas.org)
as its laboratory coordinate system.
The instrument is given a global, absolute coordinate system where the
*z* axis points in the direction of the incident beam,
the *x* axis is perpendicular to the beam in the horizontal
plane pointing left as seen from the source, and the *y* axis
points upwards. See  below for a drawing of the McStas coordinate system.  The origin of this
coordinate system is the sample position or, if this is ambiguous, the center of the sample holder
with all angles and translations set to zero.  The McStas coordinate system is
illustrated in the next figure:

.. compound::

        The McStas Coordinate System

The NeXus NXgeometry class directly uses the
:index:`McStas coordinate system <coordinate systems; McStas>`.
``NXgeometry`` classes can appear in any
component in order to specify its position.
The suggested name to use is geometry.
In ``NXgeometry`` the ``NXtranslation/values``
field defines the absolute position of the component in the McStas coordinate system. The ``NXorientation/value`` field describes
the orientation of the component as a vector of in the McStas coordinate system.


.. _Design-Coordinate-Spherical:

Simple (Spherical Polar) Coordinate System
------------------------------------------

.. index::
    geometry
    coordinate systems; spherical polar
    McStas

In this system,
the instrument is considered as a set of components through
which the incident beam passes. The variable *distance* is assigned to each component and represents the
effective beam flight path length between this component and the sample. A sign
convention is used where negative numbers represent components pre-sample and positive
numbers components post-sample. At each component there is local spherical coordinate system
with the angles *polar_angle* and *azimuthal_angle*.
The size of the sphere is the distance to the previous component.

In order to understand this spherical polar coordinate system it is helpful
to look initially at the common condition that *azimuthal_angle*
is zero. This corresponds to working directly in the horizontal scattering
plane of the instrument. In this case *polar_angle* maps
directly to the setting commonly known as *two theta*.
Now, there are instruments where components live outside of the scattering plane.
Most notably detectors. In order to describe such components we first apply
the tilt out of the horizontal scattering plane as the
*azimuthal_angle*. Then, in this tilted plane, we rotate
to the component. The beauty of this is that *polar_angle*
is always *two theta*. Which, in the case of a component
out of the horizontal scattering plane, is not identical to the value read
from the motor responsible for rotating the component. This situation is shown in
:ref:`Polar Coordinate System <fig.polar-geometry-figure>`.

..
    .. _Size-Shape:


    Size and Shape (``NXshape``)
    ============================

    .. index::
    	dictionary

    Many instrument components define
    variables to specify their size.
    For example, *radius* might be used to specify a circular object
    while *height* and
    *width* might be used to specify a rectangular object.
    Rather than specify all
    these different names, an alternative scheme is proposed based on the
    *shape* of the object and the local coordinate axes this
    shape defines. All objects would just need to specify a shape
    (*cuboid*, *cylinder* etc.) and a size
    array. Specifying ``size[3]`` would give the dimensions of the object along its
    local *(+-x,+-y,+-z*) axes; specifying ``size[6]`` would give the extent along
    *(+x,+y,+z,-x,-y,-z)* and allow for e.g. asymmetric jaws where the reference point
    may not be the centre of the rectangle.

    For example take
    ``shape="cylinder"``: the :ref:`NXtranslation` ``position`` field
    would define the location of the reference point for the origin of the local
    axes: *z* in the direction of the cylinder axis,
    *x* and *y* in plane. With no rotation,
    the object would be oriented with its local axes pointing in the direction of
    axes of the object it was defined relative to, but this can be altered with the
    ``NXorientation`` variable within position. If a ``size[3]`` array variable was
    specified, the reference point must be the centre of the cylinder and the
    dimension are ``size[0]=size[1]=radius``, ``size[2]=length/2``. If ``size[6]`` was
    specified then the reference point would be elsewhere in the object, with its
    distance from the cylinder edges along the various axes given by elements of the
    ``size[6]`` array.
