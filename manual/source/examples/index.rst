Simple examples of reading and writing NeXus data files
are provided in the :ref:`Introduction` chapter and also
in the :ref:`NAPI` chapter.

.. _Examples.code:

Code Examples in Various Languages
##################################

Each example in this section demonstrates writing and reading NeXus compliant files
in various languages with different libraries. Most examples are using the HDF5 file
format. Note however that other container formats like the legacy format HDF4 or XML
can also be used to store NeXus compliant data.

Please be aware that not all examples are up to date with the latest format recommendations.

Other tools to handle NeXus data files
######################################

The number of tools that read NeXus data files,
either for general use or to read a specific
application definition, is growing.  Many of these
are open source and so also serve as code examples. In the section
:ref:`Utilities`, we describe many applications
and software packages that can read, write, browse,
and use NeXus data files. Examples of code (mostly 
from the NeXus community) that 
read NeXus data are listed in section :ref:`language.apis`.

The NIAC welcomes your continued contributions to 
this documentation.
