Computational geometry
======================

Computational geometry is a frequently used tool for describing the shape and geometry of structural features in materials and components of instruments used for materials characterization. NeXus has a long history of base classes which serve these purposes. Upon closer inspection during the first year of the FAIRmat project, we found though that the collection of base classes could profit from an extension to make working with computational geometry data in NeXus simpler and more fine-grained.

A status report of this ongoing work is available here: :ref:`CgmsFeatures-Structure`.
