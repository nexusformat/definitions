..  Suggestions for adding to this manual:

    Look for some other "section" such as "introduction.rst" and act similarly.
    Any examples go as text files in the examples/ subdirectory and are pulled into 
    Sphinx inside a :directive:`literalcode` directive.  Look for the pattern
    or wing it.  If you are ambitious, add index entries.  Many examples of the
    constructs you might use are already in the manual.
