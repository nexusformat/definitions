NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) Mailing List
==========================================================

This list contains discussions of the :ref:`NIAC`,
which oversees the development of the NeXus data format.
Its members represent many of the major neutron and synchrotron
scattering sources in the world. Membership and posting to this list
are limited to the committee members, but the archives are public.
The NIAC mailing list is for communications specific to NIAC and not for
public contribution.
General discussions should be held in the public mailing list.

====================================

There are video conferences on NeXus roughly twice a month.
Agenda and joining details are posted on the webpage: https://www.nexusformat.org/Teleconferences.html
In addition calendar invites are sent to this list.
NeXus-Tech used to be used for discussions in the past. Now the list is moderated to only allow
communication related to holding meetings. All other traffic should go to the main list nexus@nexusformat.org

.. _NeXus.mailinglist.Developers:

NeXus Developers Mailing List (retired)
=======================================

This mailing list was for discussions concerning the technical
development of NeXus (the Definitions, NXDL, and
the NeXus Application Program Interface). There was, however, much
overlap with the general NeXus mailing list and so this separate list was
closed in October 2012, but the archive of previous posting is still available.

.. closed for new contributions per NIAC 2012
