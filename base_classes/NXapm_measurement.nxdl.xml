        Base class for collecting a run with a real or a simulated atom probe or field-ion microscope.
        
        The term run is understood as an exact synonym for session, i.e. the usage of a real or simulated
        tomograph or microscope for a certain amount of time during which one characterizes a single specimen.
        
        Research workflows for experiments and simulations of atom probe and related field-evaporation
        evolve continuously and become increasingly connected with other methods used for material
        characterization specifically electron microscopy. A few examples in this direction are:
        
        * `T. Kelly et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205&gt;`_
        * `C. Fleischmann et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010&gt;`_
        * `W. Windl et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozad067.294&gt;`_
        * `C. Freysoldt et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.176801&gt;`_
        * `G. da Costa et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54169-2&gt;`_
        
        The majority of atom probe research is performed using the so-called Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) instruments
        from AMETEK/Cameca. In addition, several research groups have built their own instruments and shared different
        aspects of the technical specifications and approaches including how these groups apply data processing e.g.:
        
        * `M. Monajem et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927622003397&gt;`_
        * `P. Stender et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621013982&gt;`_
        * `I. Dimkou et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozac051&gt;`_
        
        to name but a few.
