        Base class to detail a set of rotations, orientations, and disorientations.
        
        For getting a more detailed insight into the discussion of the
        parameterized description of orientations in materials science see:
        
        * `H.-J. Bunge &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/C2013-0-11769-2&gt;`_
        * `T. B. Britton et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2016.04.008&gt;`_

        * `A. Morawiec &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-09156-2&gt;`_
        
        Once orientations are defined, one can continue to characterize the
        misorientation and specifically the disorientation. The misorientation describes
        the rotation that is required to register the lattices of two oriented objects
        (like crystal lattice) into a crystallographic equivalent orientation:
        
        * `R. Bonnet &lt;https://doi.org/10.1107/S0567739480000186&gt;`_
        
        The concepts of mis- and disorientation are relevant when analyzing the
        crystallography of interfaces.

    <field name="reference_frame" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Reference to an instance of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` which contextualizes

    <field name="crystal_symmetry" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Point group which defines the symmetry of the crystal.
            
            This has to be at least a single string. If crystal_symmetry is not
            provided, point group 1 is assumed.
            
            In the case that misorientation or disorientation fields are used
            and the two crystal sets resolve for phases with a different
            crystal symmetry, this field needs to encode two strings:
            The first string is for phase A. The second string is for phase B.
            An example of this most complex case is the description of the
            disorientation between crystals adjoining a hetero-phase boundary.

    <field name="sample_symmetry" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Point group which defines an assumed symmetry imprinted upon processing
            the material/sample which could give rise to or may justify to use a
            simplified description of rotations, orientations, misorientations,
            and disorientations via numerical procedures that are known as
            symmetrization.
            
            If sample_symmetry is not provided, point group 1 is assumed.
            
            The traditionally used symmetrization operations within the texture
            community in Materials Science, though, have become obsolete thanks
            to improvements in methods, software, and available computing power.
            
            Therefore, users are encouraged to set the sample_symmetry to 1 (triclinic).
            
            In practice one often faces situations where indeed these assumed
            symmetries are anyway not fully observed, and thus an accepting of
            eventual inaccuracies just for the sake of reporting a simplified
            symmetrized description should be avoided.
