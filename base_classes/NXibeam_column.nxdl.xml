        Base class for a set of components equipping an instrument with FIB capabilities.
        
        Focused-ion-beam (FIB) capabilities turn especially scanning electron microscopes
        into specimen preparation labs. FIB is a material preparation technique whereby
        portions of the sample are illuminated with a focused ion beam with controlled
        intensity. The beam is controlled such that it is intense, focused, and equipped
        with sufficient ion having sufficient momentum to remove material in a controlled
        manner.
        
        The fact that an electron microscope with FIB capabilities achieves these functionalities
        via a second component (aka the ion gun) that has its own relevant control circuits,
        focusing lenses, and other components, warrants the definition of an own base class
        to group these components and distinguish them from the lenses and components for creating
        and shaping the electron beam.
        
        For more details about the relevant physics and application examples
        consult the literature, for example:

    <field name="operation_mode" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Tech-partner, microscope-, and control-software-specific name of the
            specific operation mode how the ibeam_column and its components are
            controlled to achieve specific illumination conditions.
            
            In many cases the users of an instrument do not or can not be expected to know
            all intricate spatiotemporal dynamics of their hardware. Instead, they rely on
            assumptions that the instrument, its control software, and components work as
            expected to focus on their research questions.
            
            For these cases, having a place for documenting the operation_mode is useful
            in as much as at least some constraints on how the illumination conditions were
            is documented.
