			Thus the implementation of the

	<doc>
		:ref:`NXdata` describes the plottable data and related dimension scales. 
		
		.. index:: plotting
		
		It is strongly recommended that there is at least one :ref:`NXdata`
		group in each :ref:`NXentry` group.
		Note that the fields named ``AXISNAME`` and ``DATA``
		can be defined with different names.  
		(Upper case is used to indicate that the actual name is left to the user.)
		The ``signal`` and ``axes`` attributes of the 
		``data`` group define which items 
		are plottable data and which are *dimension scales*, respectively.
		
		:ref:`NXdata` is used to implement one of the basic motivations in NeXus,
		to provide a default plot for the data of this :ref:`NXentry`.  The actual data
		might be stored in another group and (hard) linked to the :ref:`NXdata` group.

		* Each :ref:`NXdata` group will define one field as the default
		  plottable data.  The value of the ``signal`` attribute names this field.
		  Additional fields may be used to describe the dimension scales and 
		  uncertainities.
		  The ``auxiliary_signals`` attribute is a list of the other fields
		  to be plotted with the ``signal`` data.
		* The plottable data may be of arbitrary rank up to a maximum
		  of ``NX_MAXRANK=32`` (for compatibility with backend file formats).
		* The plottable data will be named as the value of 
		  the group ``signal`` attribute, such as::
		  
		    data:NXdata
		      @signal = "counts"
		      @axes = "mr"
		      @mr_indices = 0
		      counts: float[100]  --> the default dependent data
		      mr: float[100]  --> the default independent data
		  
		  The field named in the ``signal`` attribute **must** exist, either
		  directly as a NeXus field or defined through a link.
		
		* The group ``axes`` attribute will name the
		  *dimension scale* associated with the plottable data.

		If available, the standard deviations of the data are to be
		stored in a data set of the same rank and dimensions, with the name ``errors``. 

		* For each data dimension, there should be a one-dimensional array
		  of the same length.
		* These one-dimensional arrays are the *dimension scales* of the
		  data,  *i.e*. the values of the independent variables at which the data
		  is measured, such as scattering angle or energy transfer.
		
		.. index:: link
		.. index:: axes (attribute)
		
		The preferred method to associate each data dimension with
		its respective dimension scale is to specify the field name
		of each dimension scale in the group ``axes`` attribute as a string list.
		Here is an example for a 2-D data set *data* plotted 
		against *time*, and *pressure*.  (An additional *temperature* data set 
		is provided and could be selected as an alternate for the *pressure* axis.)::

		  data_2d:NXdata
		    @signal="data"
		    @axes=["time", "pressure"]
		    @pressure_indices=1
		    @temperature_indices=1
		    @time_indices=0
		    data: float[1000,20]
		    pressure: float[20]
		    temperature: float[20]
		    time: float[1000]

		.. rubric:: Old methods to identify the plottable data
		
		There are two older methods of associating 
		each data dimension to its respective dimension scale.
		Both are now out of date and
		should not be used when writing new data files.
		However, client software should expect to see data files
		written with any of these methods.
		
		  * One method uses the ``axes`` 
		    attribute to specify the names of each *dimension scale*.
		
		  * The oldest method uses the ``axis`` attribute on each
		    *dimension scale* to identify
		    with an integer the axis whose value is the number of the dimension.

		.. index: !plot; axis label
		   plot, axis units
		   units
		   dimension scale

		Each axis of the plot may be labeled with information from the 
		dimension scale for that axis.  The optional ``@long_name`` attribute
		is provided as the axis label default.  If ``@long_name`` is not
		defined, then use the name of the dimension scale.  A ``@units`` attribute,
		if available, may be added to the axis label for further description.
		See the section :ref:`Design-Units` for more information.

		.. index: !plot; axis title

		The optional ``title`` field, if available, provides a suggested
		title for the plot.  If no ``title`` field is found in the :ref:`NXdata`
		group, look for a ``title`` field in the parent :ref:`NXentry` group,
		with a fallback to displaying the path to the :ref:`NXdata` group.

		NeXus is about how to find and annotate the data to be plotted 
		but not to describe how the data is to be plotted.

    <attribute name="AXISNAME_depends">
        <doc>
             Points to the path to a field defining the axis on which the ``AXISNAME`` axis depends.
             
             This concept allows to store a link to an axis to a respective field the Nexus hierarchy
             
             Here, *AXISNAME* is to be replaced by the name of each
             field described in the ``axes`` attribute.
             
             Examples:
             	If a calibration has been performed, ``@AXISNAME_depends`` links to the result of
             	that calibration:
             	  @AXISNAME_depends: '/entry/process/calibration/calibrated_axis'
             	If the axis is given in a detecotr, ``@AXISNAME_depends`` links to that detector axis:
