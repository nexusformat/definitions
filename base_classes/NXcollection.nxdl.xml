	<!-- 
		The ignoreExtra* attributes are used in the definition to
		avoid warning messages that would be generated from 
		unexpected groups, fields, and attributes.
		Since no groups or attributes are declared here, _every_
		child of this class would generate a warning message without this 
		attribute being set to "true".
	-->

	<doc>
		An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line.
		
		Use :ref:`NXcollection` to gather together any set of terms.
		The original suggestion is to use this as a container 
		class for the description of a beamline.
		
		For NeXus validation, :ref:`NXcollection` will always generate 
		a warning since it is always an optional group.  
		Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
		an :ref:`NXcollection` group will not be validated.

	   NOTE
	   =====
	   
	   NXcollection is an unvalidated class, do not add any subgroups.
