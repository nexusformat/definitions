        Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDXS).
        
        `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation &lt;https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308&gt;`_ should be used.
        
        X-ray spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive technique. Therefore, three-dimensional elemental
        characterization requires typically a sequence of characterization and preparation of the
        surface to expose new surface layer that can be characterized in the next acquisition.
        In effect, the resulting three-dimensional elemental information mappings are truly the
        result of a correlation and post-processing of several measurements which is the field
        of correlative tomographic usage of electron microscopy.

                These element-specific EDS maps are instances of :ref:`NXimage`
