         Computational geometry description of a set of polylines in Euclidean space.
         
         Each polyline is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
         Each polyline must have a start and an end point.
         The sequence describes the positive traversal along the polyline when walking
         from the start vertex to the end/last vertex.

             Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
             polylines. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
             or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
             interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
             For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.
             
             The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
             identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
             or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

    <!--Users are encouraged to reduce the vertex set to the unique vertices.

identifier. In fact, it is possible to distinguish two vertices as two when
they share the same position in space but have different identifiers.-->
    <field name="vertices" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Positions of the vertices which support the members of the polyline set.
             
             Users are encouraged to reduce the vertices to unique set of positions
             and vertices as this supports a more efficient storage of the geometry data.
             It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively in which
             case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
             Naively here means that one for example stores each vertex of a triangle
             mesh even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
             the positions of these vertices do not have to be duplicated.

    <field name="polylines" type="NX_INT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
             Sequence of vertex identifiers which describe each polyline.
             
             A trivial example is a set with two polylines with three vertices each.
             If the polylines meet in a junction, say the second vertex is shared
             and marking the junction between the two polylines, it is possible that
             there are only five unique positions suggesting five unique vertices.
             
             A non-trivial example is a set with several polylines, each of which with
             eventually different number of vertices. The array stores the vertex
             identifiers in the order how the polylines are visited:
             
             The first entry is the identifier of the start vertex of the first polyline,
             followed by the second vertex of the first polyline, until the last vertex
             of the polyline. Thereafter, the start vertex of the second polyline, and
             so on and so forth. Using the (cumulated) counts in number_of_vertices,
             the vertices of the n-th polyline can be accessed on the following 
             array index interval:
             :math:`[\sum_{i=0}^{i=N-1}, \sum_{i=0}^{i=N}]`.
