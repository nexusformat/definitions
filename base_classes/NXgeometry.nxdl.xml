        legacy class - recommend to use :ref:`NXtransformations` now
        
        It is recommended that instances of :ref:`NXgeometry` be converted to 
        use :ref:`NXtransformations`.
        
        This is the description for a general position of a component. 
        It is recommended to name an instance of :ref:`NXgeometry` as "geometry"
        to aid in the use of the definition in simulation codes such as McStas.
        Also, in HDF, linked items must share the same name.
        However, it might not be possible or practical in all situations.
