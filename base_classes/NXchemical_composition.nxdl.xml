        <doc>
            Reporting compositions as atom and weight percent yields both
            dimensionless quantities but their conceptual interpretation differs.
            A normalization based on atom_percent counts relative to the
            total number of atoms which are of a particular type.
            By contrast, weight_percent normalization factorizes in the
            respective mass of the elements. Software libraries that work with
            units, like pint in Python, are challenged by these differences as
            at.-% and wt.-% are both fractional quantities.

                Composition is reported either normalized for atomic or weight
                percent. The field normalization should be used to communicate
                this explicitly. Composition should be reported consistently
