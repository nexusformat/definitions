                    kinetic energy, :math:`R = (E_K - W)/E_p`, is scanned, but the pass energy :math:`E_p` is kept constant.
                    Here, :math:`W = e \phi` is the spectrometer work function (with the potential difference :math:`\phi`
                    between the electrochemical potential of electrons in the bulk and the electrostatic potential of an electron in the
                    vacuum just outside the surface).
                    
                    This mode is often used in X-ray/ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) because the energy resolution does
                    not change with changing energy (due to the constant pass energy).

                    constant :math:`\Delta E/E` mode, where the pass energy is scanned such that the electron retardation
                    ratio is constant. In this mode, electrons of all energies are decelerated with this same
                    fixed factor. Thus, the pass energy is proportional to the kinetic energy. This mode is often
                    used in Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to improve S/N for high-KE electrons, but this
                    leads to a changing energy resolution (:math:`\Delta E \sim E_p`) at different kinetic energies.
                    It can however also be used in XPS.

                    This concept is related to term `12.66`_ of the ISO 18115-1:2023 standard.
                    
                    .. _12.66: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:18115:-1:ed-3:v1:en:term:12.66

                <doc>
                    In the fixed energy (FE) mode, the intensity for one single kinetic energy is measured for a
                    specified time. This mode is particularly useful during setup or alignment of the
                    electron analyzer, for analysis of stability of the excitation source or for sample
                    alignment.
                    
                    Since the mode measures intensity as a function of time, the difference in channel signals
                    is not of interest. Therefore, the signals from all channels are summed.

            <item value="snapshot">
                <doc>
                    Snapshot mode does not involve an energy scan and instead collects data from all channels of
                    the detector without averaging. The resulting spectrum reflects the energy distribution of
                    particles passing through the analyzer using the current settings. This mode is commonly used
                    to position the detection energy at the maximum of a peak and record the signal, enabling faster
                    data acquisition within a limited energy range compared to FAT. Snapshot measurements are
                    particularly suitable for CCD and DLD detectors, which have multiple channels and can accurately
                    display the peak shape. While five or nine-channel detectors can also be used for snapshot
                    measurements, their energy resolution is relatively lower.

            <item value="dither">
                <doc>
                    In dither acquisition mode, the kinetic energy of the analyzer is randomly varied by a small value
                    around a central value and at fixed pass energy. This reduces or removes inhomogeneities
                    of the detector efficiency, such as e.g. imposed by a mesh in front of the detector.
                    Mostly relevant for CCD/DLD type of detectors.
