		A NeXus transliteration of a PDB file, to be validated only as a PDB
		rather than in NeXus.

		Use :ref:`NXpdb` to incorporate the information in an arbitrary
		PDB into a NeXus file.

		The main suggestion is to use this as a container
		class for a PDB entry to describe a sample in NXsample,
		but it may be more appropriate to place this higher in the
		hierarchy, say in NXentry.

		The structure has to follow the structure of a PDB
		with each PDB data block mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb,
		using a lowercase version of the data block name as the name
		of the NeXus group, each PDB category in that data block
		mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb and with each PDB column
		mapped to a NeXus field.  Each column in a looped PDB category
		should always be presented as a 1-dimensional array.  The columns 
		in an unlooped PDB category should be presented as scalar values.  
		If a PDB category specifies particular units for columns, the same 
		units should beused for the corresponding fields.

		A PDB entry is unambigous when all information is carried as text.
		All text data should be presented as quoted strings, with the quote
		marks except for the null values "." or "?"

		For clarity in NXpdb form, numeric data may be presented using the
		numeric types specified in the mmCIF dictionary.  In that case,
		if a PDB null value, "." or "?", is contained in a numeric column, the
		IEEE nan should be used for "?" and the IEEE inf should be used for ".".

		An arbitrary DDL2 CIF file can be represented in NeXus using NXpdb.  
		However, if save frames are required, an NXpdb_class  attribute with the
		value "CBF_cbfsf" is required for each NeXus group representing a save
		frame.  NXpdb attributes are not required for other CIF components,
		but may be used to provide internal documentation.

		The nesting of NXpdb groups and datasets that correspond to a CIF with
		two categories and one saveframe, including the NXpdb_class attribues is::

			(datablock1):NXpdb
			   @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfdb
			   (category1):NXpdb
			     @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
			      (column_name1):[...]
			      (column_name2):[...]
			      (column_name3):[...]
			      ...
			   (category2):NXpdb
			      @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
			      (column_name4):[...]
			      (column_name5):[...]
			      (column_name6):[...]
			      ...
			   (saveframe1):NXpdb
			      @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfsf
			      (category3):NXpdb
			        @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
			        (column_name7):[...]
			        (column_name8):[...]
			        (column_name9):[...]
			         ...
			      ...
			   ...

			      

		For example, a PDB entry that begins::

			data_1YVA
			#
			 _entry.id   1YVA
			#
			_audit_conform.dict_name       mmcif_pdbx.dic
			_audit_conform.dict_version    5.279
			_audit_conform.dict_location   http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic
			#
			loop_
			_database_2.database_id
			_database_2.database_code
			PDB   1YVA
			RCSB  RCSB031959
			WWPDB D_1000031959
			#

		would produce::
	
			sample:NXsample
			   1yva:NXpdb
			     entry:NXpdb
				 id:"1YVA"
			     audit_conform:NXpdb
				 dict_name:"mmcif_pdbx.dic"
				 dict_version:"5.279"
				 dict_location:"http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic"
			     database_2:NXpdb
				 database_id:["PDB","RCSB","WWPDB"]
				 database_code:["1YVA","RCSB031959","D_1000031959"]

		another example is the following excerpt from pdb entry 9ins, giving the sequences
		of the two chains::

			loop_
			_entity_poly.entity_id
			_entity_poly.nstd_linkage
			_entity_poly.nstd_monomer
			_entity_poly.pdbx_seq_one_letter_code 
			_entity_poly.pdbx_seq_one_letter_code_can
			_entity_poly.type
			1 no no GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN polypeptide(L)
			2 no no FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA
			polypeptide(L)

		which converts to::

			entity_poly:NXpdb
			  @NXpdb_class:CBF_cbfcat
			  entity_id:["1", "2"]
			  nstd_linkage:["no", "no"]
			  nstd_monomer:["no", "no"]
			  pdbx_seq_one_letter_code:["GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN","FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA"]
			  pdbx_seq_one_letter_code_can:["GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN","FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA"]
			  type:["polypeptide(L)", "polypeptide(L)"]
