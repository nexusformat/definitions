        Properties of the neutron or X-ray beam at a given location. 

        This group is intended to be referenced
        by beamline component groups within the :ref:`NXinstrument` group or by the :ref:`NXsample` group. This group is
        especially valuable in storing the results of instrument simulations in which it is useful
        to specify the beam profile, time distribution etc. at each beamline component. Otherwise,
        its most likely use is in the :ref:`NXsample` group in which it defines the results of the neutron
        scattering by the sample, e.g., energy transfer, polarizations. Finally, There are cases where the beam is
        considered as a beamline component and this group may be defined as a subgroup directly inside
        :ref:`NXinstrument`, in which case it is recommended that the position of the beam is specified by an 
        :ref:`NXtransformations` group, unless the beam is at the origin (which is the sample).

        Note that incident_wavelength and related fields can be a scalar values or arrays, depending on the use case.
        To support these use cases, the explicit dimensionality of these fields is not specified, but it can be inferred
        by the presense of and shape of accompanying fields, such as incident_wavelength_weights for a polychromatic beam.

            In the case of a monochromatic beam this is the scalar
            wavelength.

            Several other use cases are permitted, depending on the
            presence or absence of other incident_wavelength_X
            fields.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam this is an array of
            length **m** of wavelengths, with the relative weights
            in ``incident_wavelength_weights``.

            In the case of a monochromatic beam that varies shot-
            to-shot, this is an array of wavelengths, one for each
            recorded shot. Here, ``incident_wavelength_weights`` and
            incident_wavelength_spread are not set.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
            shot, this is an array of length **m** with the relative
            weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D array.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
            shot and where the channels also vary, this is a 2D array
            of dimensions **nP** by **m** (slow to fast) with the
            relative weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D
            array.

            Note, :ref:`variants &lt;Design-Variants&gt;` are a good way
            to represent several of these use cases in a single dataset,
            e.g. if a calibrated, single-value wavelength value is
            available along with the original spectrum from which it
            was calibrated.

             Polarization vector on entering beamline component using Stokes notation

             The Stokes parameters are four components labelled I,Q,U,V or S_0,S_1,S_2,S_3.
             These are defined with the standard Nexus coordinate frame unless it is
             overridden by an NXtransformations field pointed to by a depends_on attribute.
             The last component, describing the circular polarization state, is positive
             for a right-hand circular state - that is the electric field vector rotates
             clockwise at the sample and over time when observed from the source.

             I (S_0) is the beam intensity (often normalized to 1). Q, U, and V scale 
             linearly with the total degree of polarization, and indicate the relative
             magnitudes of the pure linear and circular orientation contributions.
              
             Q (S_1) is linearly polarized along the x axis (Q &gt; 0) or y axis (Q &lt; 0).
              
             U (S_2) is linearly polarized along the x==y axis (U &gt; 0) or the
             -x==y axis (U &lt; 0). 

             V (S_3) is circularly polarized. V &gt; 0 when the electric field vector rotates
             clockwise at the sample with respect to time when observed from the source; 
             V &lt; 0 indicates the opposite rotation.

            The NeXus coordinate system defines the Z axis to be along the nominal beam
