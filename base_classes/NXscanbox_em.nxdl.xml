    <doc>
        Scan box and coils which deflect a beam of charged particles in a controlled manner.
        
        The scan box is instructed by (an) instance(s) of :ref:`NXprogram`, some control software,
        which is not necessarily the same program as the one controlling other parts of the instrument.
        
        The scanbox directs the probe of charged particles (electrons, ions)
        to controlled locations according to a scan scheme and plan.

    <field name="scan_schema" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Name of the typically tech-partner-specific term that specifies an
            automated protocol which details how the components of the scan_box
            and the instrument work together to achieve a controlled
            scanning of the beam (over the sample surface).
            
            Oftentimes users do not need to or are not able to disentangle the intricate
            details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their instrument. Instead, often
            they rely on the assumption that the instrument and its controlling programs
            work as expected. The field scan_schema can be used to add some constraints
            on how the beam was scanned over the surface.

            Time period during which the beam remains at one position.

            Details about components which realize the deflection technically.
            
            This concept should be used for all those components that implement
            the scanning of the beam, while components like beam blankers etc. should
            use rather the NXdeflector concept of the NXebeam_column base class.
