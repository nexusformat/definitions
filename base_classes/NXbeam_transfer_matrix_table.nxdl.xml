        Contains data structures of an experimental optical setup (i.e., multiple
        transfer matrix tables).   These data structures are used to relate physical
        properties of two beams (NXbeam) which have one common optical component
        (NXcomponent) (one specific transfer matrix).
        One of these beams is an input beam and the other one is an output beam.
        
        The data describes the change of beam properties, e.g. the intensity of a
        beam is reduced because the transmission coefficient of the beam device is
        lower than 1.

            Select which type of data was recorded, for example aperture and
            focal length.
            It is possible to have multiple selections. This selection defines
            how many columns (N_variables) are stored in the data array.
            N in the name, is the index number in which order the given
            property is listed.

            Contains the datastructure which relates beam properties of an
            input and output beam as result of the input beam interaction
            with the beam device.
            
            Transfer matrix relationship between N input beams and M output beams.
            It contains a table with the relevant matrices to be used for different
            transmitted properties (such as polarization, intensity, phase).
            
            Data structure for all transfermatrices of a beam device in a setup.
            For each combination of N input and M output beams and for L physical
            concept (i.e. beam intensity), one matrix can be defined.
            
            In this way, the transfer matrix table has the dimension NxM.
            
            For each entry, in this transfer matrix, there are L formalisms.
            Each formalism has the dimension math:`dim(L_i)xdim(L_i)`,
            whereby math:`L_i` is the specific physical concept (Intensity, polarization, direction).
            
            A beamsplitter with two input laser beams can have a total of
            four transfermatrices (2 Input x 2 Output).
            
            The dimension of the transfer matrix depends on the parameters.
            Examples are:
            1x1 for intensity/power
            2x2 for jones formalism
            3x3 for direction
