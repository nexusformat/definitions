A draft of a new base class to describe a window in a optical setup or device-->
<definition xmlns="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" category="base" type="group" name="NXopt_window" extends="NXaperture" xsi:schemaLocation="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1 ../nxdl.xsd">

        A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.
        
        This first verion originates from NXopt to describe cryostate windows
        and possible influences for ellipsometry measurements.
        
        For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
        etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
        direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
        window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
        windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
        use a second 'WINDOW(NXaperture)' field.
        
        The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
        measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
        a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
        in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
        performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference data should be
        considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
        should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.
        
        The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
        beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
        defined by the 'depends_on' field.

                    corrected, i.e. either mathematically or by performing a
                    reference measurement. In the latter case, provide the link to

                    Link to the NeXus file which describes the reference data if a
                    reference measurement for window correction was performed.
                    Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on a reference
                    sample and on the same sample, and using the same conditions as
                    for the actual measurement with and without windows. It should
                    have been conducted as close in time to the actual measurement
                    as possible.
