In general, an alpha complex is a disconnected and non-pure complex,
meaning in particular that the alpha complex may have singular faces.
so the number of cells, faces and edges depends on how a specific alpha complex,
i.e. an alpha-shape of S for alpha, is filtrated with respect to k < d-dimensional
simplices. Here we assume that number_of_cells, number_of_faces, number_of_edges
are reported assuming one filtrates these simplices according to type.
also using the assumption the base class reports the unique vertices
of the specifically filtrated alpha complex.-->

a triangulation is more than a triangle (soup)/set because there it has connectivity
customize the NXcg_triangle_set base class members such that connectivity can be contained naturally
we need to find also a better name for this, what people intutive understand
as the interior, may not even exist for a given alpha value
