In general, an alpha complex is a disconnected and non-pure complex,
meaning in particular that the alpha complex may have singular faces.
so the number of cells, faces and edges depends on how a specific alpha complex,
i.e. an alpha-shape of S for alpha, is filtrated with respect to k < d-dimensional
simplices. Here we assume that number_of_cells, number_of_faces, number_of_edges
are reported assuming one filtrates these simplices according to mode.
also using the assumption the base class reports the unique vertices
of the specifically filtrated alpha complex.-->

add for each triangle if desirable a notation of whether the simplex is
exterior, regular, singular, or interior with respect to the alpha complex
but a triangulation is more than a triangle (soup)/set because there is
connectivity information
customize the NXcg_triangle_set base class members such that connectivity
information is contained
we need to find also a better name for this, what people intutive understand
as the interior, may not even exist for a given alpha value
more specifically it is the set of filtrated cells acknowledging mode
e.g. the interior cells of the regularized alpha complex-->
