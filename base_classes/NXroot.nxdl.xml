        The root of a NeXus file.

        In the NeXus standard, only NXentry groups are allowed at the
        root level of a file, although it is permitted to include
        additional groups and fields that are not part of the NeXus
        standard and will not be validated by NeXus tools. NeXus defines
        a number of root-level attributes that can be used to annotate
        the NeXus tree.

        Note that NXroot is the only base class that does not inherit
        from the NXobject class, since the latter permits the inclusion
        of NeXus objects that are not allowed at the root level.

            Version of NeXus API used in writing the file.

            A repository containing the application definitions
            used for creating this file.
            If the ``NeXus_release`` attribute contains a commit distance and hash,

    </attribute>
    <attribute name="NeXus_release">
        <doc>
            The version of NeXus definitions used in writing the file. This can either be a date-based
            NeXus release (e.g., YYYY.MM), see https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/releases or
            a version tag that includes additional development information, such as a commit distance and
            a Git hash. This is typically formatted as  `vYYYY.MM.post1.dev&lt;commit-distance&gt;-g&lt;git-hash&gt;`,
            where `YYYY.MM` refers to the base version of the NeXus definitions. `post1.dev&lt;commit-distance&gt;` 
            indicates that the definitions are based on a commit after the base version (post1), with
            `&lt;commit-distance&gt;` being the number of commits since that version. `g&lt;git-hash&gt;` is the 
            abbreviated Git hash that identifies the specific commit of the definitions being used.

            If the version includes both a commit distance and a Git hash, the ``NeXus_repository`` 
            attribute must be included, specifying the URL of the repository containing that version.

            Declares which :ref:`NXentry` group contains
            the data to be shown by default.
            It is used to resolve ambiguity when
            more than one :ref:`NXentry` group exists.
            The value :ref:`names &lt;validItemName>` the default :ref:`NXentry` group.  The
            value must be the name of a child of the current group. The child must be a
            NeXus group or a link to a NeXus group.

            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
