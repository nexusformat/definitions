         Computational geometry description of a mesh of triangles.
         
         The mesh may be self-intersecting and have holes but the
         triangles used must not be degenerated.

        <doc>
             A graph-based approach to describe the mesh when it is also desired
             to perform topological processing or analyses on the mesh.
