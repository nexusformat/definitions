			(x,y,z)
			This field describes the lateral movement of a component.
			The pair of groups NXtranslation and NXorientation together
			describe the position of a component. 
			For absolute position, the origin is the scattering center (where a perfectly 
			aligned sample would be) with the z-axis pointing downstream and the y-axis 
			pointing gravitationally up. For a relative position the NXtranslation is 
			taken into account before the NXorientation. The axes are right-handed and 
			orthonormal.

            Declares which child group contains a path leading 
            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
