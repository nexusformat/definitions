	<doc>
		Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe a geometry.
		May also contain axes that do not move and therefore do not have a transformation
		type specified, but are useful in understanding coordinate frames within which
		transformations are done, or in documenting important directions, such as the
		direction of gravity.

		A nested sequence of transformations lists the translation and rotation steps
		needed to describe the position and orientation of any movable or fixed device.

		There will be one or more transformations (axes) defined by one or more fields
		for each transformation. Transformations can also be described by NXlog groups when
		the values change with time. The all-caps name ``AXISNAME`` designates the
		particular axis generating a transformation (e.g. a rotation axis or a translation
		axis or a general axis).   The attribute ``units="NX_TRANSFORMATION"`` designates the
		units will be appropriate to the ``transformation_type`` attribute:

		* ``NX_LENGTH`` for ``translation``
		* ``NX_ANGLE`` for ``rotation``
		* ``NX_UNITLESS`` for axes for which no transformation type is specified

		This class will usually contain all axes of a sample stage or goniometer or
		a detector. The NeXus default :ref:`McSTAS coordinate frame&lt;Design-CoordinateSystem&gt;`
		is assumed, but additional useful coordinate axes may be defined by using axes for which
		no transformation type has been specified.

		**Transformation chain**

		The entry point of a chain of transformations is a field called ``depends_on``
		will be outside of this class and points to a field in here. Following the chain may
		also require following ``depends_on`` links to transformations outside, for example
		to a common base table.  If a relative path is given, it is relative to the group
		enclosing the ``depends_on`` specification.

		For a chain of three transformations, where :math:`T_1` depends on :math:`T_2`
		which in turn depends on :math:`T_3`, the final *active* transformation
		matrix :math:`T_f` is

		.. math:: T_f = T_3 . T_2 . T_1

		For example when positioning a flat detector, its pixel positions in the laboratory
		reference frame (:ref:`McSTAS coordinate frame&lt;Design-CoordinateSystem&gt;` by default)
		can be calculated by

		.. math:: X_\text{lab} = T_f . X_\text{pixel} = T_3 . T_2 . T_1 . X_\text{pixel}

		Note that :math:`T_1` comes first in the *depends-on* chain and is also applied first
		to the pixel coordinates.

		When we say transformation :math:`A` *depends on* transformation :math:`B` we mean that
		the physical motor that realizes :math:`A` is *stacked on top of* the motor that realizes :math:`B`.
		So the activate coordinate transformation :math:`A` needs to be applied to a coordinate
		before applying :math:`B`. In other words :math:`X' = B . A . X`.

		**Transformation matrix**

		In explicit terms, the transformations are a subset of affine transformations expressed as
		4x4 active transformation matrices that act on homogeneous coordinates, :math:`X=[x,y,z,1]^T`.

		For rotation and translation,

		.. math:: T_r &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} R &amp; o \\ 0_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \\ T_t &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} I_3  &amp; t + o \\ 0_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}

		where :math:`R` is the usual 3x3 rotation matrix, :math:`o` is an offset vector,
		:math:`0_3` is a row of 3 zeros, :math:`I_3` is the 3x3 identity matrix and
		:math:`t` is the translation vector.

		:math:`o` is given by the ``offset`` attribute, :math:`t` is given by the ``vector``
		attribute multiplied by the field value, and :math:`R` is defined as a rotation
		about an axis in the direction of ``vector``, of angle of the field value.

		**Usage**

		One possible use of ``NXtransformations`` is to define the motors and
		transformations for a diffractometer (goniometer).  Such use is mentioned
		in the ``NXinstrument`` base class.  Use one ``NXtransformations`` group 
		for each diffractometer and name the group appropriate to the device.
		Collecting the motors of a sample table or xyz-stage in an NXtransformations
		group is equally possible.

		Following the section on the general description of axis in NXtransformations is a section which
		documents the fields commonly used within NeXus for positioning purposes and their meaning. Whenever
		there is a need for positioning a beam line component please use the existing names. Use as many fields
		as needed in order to position the component. Feel free to add more axis if required. In the description
		given below, only those atttributes which are defined through the name are spcified. Add the other attributes
		of the full set:

		* vector
		* offset
		* transformation_type
		* depends_on

		as needed.

		**Example 1: goniometer**

		Position a sample mounted on a goniometer in the :ref:`McSTAS coordinate frame&lt;Design-CoordinateSystem&gt;`.

		The sample is oriented as follows

		.. math:: X_\text{lab} = R(\vec{v}_\omega, \omega) . 
								 T(\vec{v}_z, \text{sam}_z) . 
								 T(\vec{v}_y, \text{sam}_y) . 
								 T(\vec{v}_x, \text{sam}_x) . 
								 R(\vec{v}_\chi, \chi) . 
								 R(\vec{v}_\varphi, \varphi) . X_s

		where

		* :math:`R(\vec{v},a)` is a rotation around vector :math:`\vec{v}` with angle :math:`a`
		* :math:`T(\vec{u},t)` is a translation along vector :math:`\vec{u}` over a distance :math:`t`
		* :math:`X_s` a coordinate in the sample reference frame.

		**Example 2: different coordinate system**

		Define a laboratory reference frame with the X-axis along the beam and the Z-axis opposite to the direction of gravity.
		Three point detectors are positioned in this reference:

		* *transmission*:
			* point detector in the beam
			* 20 cm downstream from the sample (the origin of the reference frame)
		* *vertical*:
			* point detector 10 cm downstream from the sample
			* making an angle of 5 degrees with the beam w.r.t. the sample
			* positioned in the XZ-plane above the XY-plane
		* *horizontal*:
			* point detector 11 cm downstream from the sample
			* making an angle of 6 degrees with the beam w.r.t. the sample
			* positioned in the XY-plane above the XZ-plane

		The coordinates of the point detectors in the laboratory reference frame are

		* *transmission*: :math:`X_\text{lab} = T_x(20) . X_d`
		* *vertical*: :math:`X_\text{lab} = R_y(-5) . T_x(10) . X_d`
		* *horizontal*: :math:`X_\text{lab} = R_x(-90) . R_y(-6) . T_x(11) . X_d`

		where

		* :math:`T_x`, :math:`T_y`, :math:`T_z`: active transformation matrices for translation along the X, Y and Z axes
		* :math:`R_x`, :math:`R_y`, :math:`R_z`: active transformation matrices for rotation around the X, Y and Z axes
		* :math:`X_d` is a coordinate in the detector reference frame.

		Note that as these are point detectors, we only have one coordinate :math:`X_d=[0,0,0,1]^T`.
