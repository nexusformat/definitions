	<doc>
		Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe a geometry.
		May also contain axes that do not move and therefore do not have a transformation
		type specified, but are useful in understanding coordinate frames within which
		transformations are done, or in documenting important directions, such as the
		direction of gravity.

		A nested sequence of transformations lists the offset and rotation steps
		needed to describe the position and orientation of any movable or fixed device.

		There will be one or more transformations (axes) defined by one or more fields
		for each transformation.  The all-caps name ``AXISNAME`` designates the
		particular axis generating a transformation (e.g. a rotation axis or a translation
		axis or a general axis).   The attribute ``units="NX_TRANSFORMATION"`` designates the
		units will be appropriate to the ``transformation_type`` attribute:

		* ``NX_LENGTH`` for ``translation``
		* ``NX_ANGLE`` for ``rotation``
		* ``NX_UNITLESS`` for axes for which no transformation type is specified

		This class will usually contain all axes of a sample stage or goniometer or
		a detector.  The NeXus default McSTAS coordinate frame is assumed, but additional
		useful coordinate axes may be defined by using axes for which no transformation
		type has been specified.

		The entry point (``depends_on``) will be outside of this class and point to a
		field in here. Following the chain may also require following ``depends_on``
		links to transformations outside, for example to a common base table.  If
		a relative path is given, it is relative to the group enclosing the ``depends_on``
		specification.

		For a chain of three transformations, where :math:`T_1` depends on :math:`T_2`
		and that in turn depends on :math:`T_3`, the final transformation :math:`T_f` is

		.. math:: T_f = T_3 T_2 T_1

		In explicit terms, the transformations are a subset of affine transformations
		expressed as 4x4 matrices that act on homogeneous coordinates, :math:`w=(x,y,z,1)^T`.

		For rotation and translation,

		.. math:: T_r &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} R &amp; o \\ 0_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \\ T_t &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} I_3  &amp; t + o \\ 0_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}

		where :math:`R` is the usual 3x3 rotation matrix, :math:`o` is an offset vector,
		:math:`0_3` is a row of 3 zeros, :math:`I_3` is the 3x3 identity matrix and
		:math:`t` is the translation vector.

		:math:`o` is given the ``offset`` attribute, :math:`t` is given by the ``vector``
		attribute multiplied by the field value, and :math:`R` is defined as a rotation
		about an axis in the direction of ``vector``, of angle of the field value.
