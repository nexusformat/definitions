        A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.
        
        This describes cryostat windows and other possible influences for ellipsometry
        measurements.
        
        For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
        etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
        direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
        window) (looking from the sample).
        
        The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
        measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
        a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
        in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
        performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference measurements should be
        considered as a separate experiment (with a separate NeXus file), and
        the reference data shall be :ref:`linked &lt;Design-Links&gt;` in
        ``reference_data_link``.
        
        The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
        beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
        defined by the 'depends_on' field.

                reference measurement. In the latter case, provide the link to
                to the reference data in ``reference_data_file``.

                :ref:`External link &lt;Design-Links&gt;` to the data field in the NeXus file which describes                   
                the reference data if a reference measurement for window correction 
                was performed.

                Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on the same sample,
                using the same conditions as for the actual measurement, with
                and, if possible, without windows. It should have been conducted as close in time
                to the actual measurement as possible.
                
                Ideally, the link uses the relative path with respect to the actual
                NeXus file.
