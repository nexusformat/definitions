         Computational geometry description of a set of polylines.
         
         Each polyline is built from a sequence of vertices (points with identifiers).
         Each polyline must have a start and an end point.
         The sequence describes the traversal along the polyline when
         walking from the first to the last vertex.

             Users are encouraged to reduce the vertices to unique positions and vertices
             as this often supports with storing geometry data more efficiently.
             It is also possible though to store the vertex positions naively
             in which case vertices_are_unique is likely False.
             Naively, here means that one stores each vertex of a triangle mesh
             even though many vertices are shared between triangles and thus
             storing multiple copies of their positions is redundant.

             Sequence of identifier for vertices how they build each polyline.
             
             A trivial example is a set with two polylines with three vertices each.
             If the polylines meet at a vertex (assume for example that the second vertex
             is shared and marking the junction between the two polylines), it is possible
             that there are only five unique positions. This suggests to store five
             unique vertices.
             
             A non-trivial example is a set with several polylines. Assume that each
             has a different number of vertices. The array stores the identifier of
             the vertices in the sequence how the polylines are visited:
             
             The first entry is the identifier of the first vertex of the first polyline,
             followed by the second vertex of the first polyline, until the last vertex
             of the first polyline.
             Thereafter, the first vertex of the second polyline, and so on and so forth.
             Using the (cumulated) counts in number_of_vertices (:math:`n^v_i`),
             the vertices of the N-th polyline can be accessed on the array
             index interval :math:`[\sum_{i=0}^{i=N-1} n^v_i, \sum_{i=0}^{i=N} n^v_i]`.
