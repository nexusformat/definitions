         An identifier for a (persistent) resource, e.g., a DOI or orcid.
    </doc>
    <field name="service" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             The service by which the resource can be resolved.

        <doc>
             The unique code, IRI or hash to resolve this reference.
             Typically, this is stated by the service which is considered a complete
             identifier, e.g., for a DOI it's something of the form `10.1107/S1600576714027575`
             or `https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576714027575`, which are both resolvable.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="is_persistent" type="NX_BOOLEAN">
        <doc>
             True if the identifier is persistent (i.e., unique and available indefinitely),
             False otherwise.
        </doc>
