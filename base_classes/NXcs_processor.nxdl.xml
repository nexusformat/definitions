    <doc>
        Base class for reporting the description of processing units of a computer.
        
        Examples are e.g. classical so-called central processing units (CPUs),
        coprocessors, graphic cards, accelerator processing units or a system of these.

        <doc>
            Typical examples for the granularization of processing units are:
            
            * A desktop computer with a single CPU; describe using one instance of NXcircuit.
            * A dual-socket server; describe using two instances of NXcircuit.
            * A server with two dual-socket server nodes; describe with four
              instances of NXcircuit surplus a field that defines their level
              in the hierarchy.
        </doc>
        <field name="type" type="NX_CHAR">
            <doc>
                General type of the processing unit e.g.
                
                * pu, processing core or hyper-threading core
                * cpu, (multi-)core central processing unit
                * gpu, (multi-)core general purpose processing unit
                * fpga, field programmable gate array
