	<time_of_flight type="NX_INT[i]" units="10^n second">
		{A list of time of flight for each event as it comes in. This list is for all pulses with information to attach to a particular pulse located in events_per_pulse.}?

		{There will be extra information in the NXdetector to convert pixel_number to detector_number. This list is for all pulses with information to attach to a particular pulse located in events_per_pulse.}?

		{This connects the index "i" to the index "j". The jth element is the number of events in "i" that occured during the jth pulse.}?
