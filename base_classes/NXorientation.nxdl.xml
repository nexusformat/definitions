			The orientation information is stored as direction cosines. The direction cosines will
			be between the local coordinate directions and the reference directions (to origin or
			relative NXgeometry). Calling the local unit vectors (x',y',z') and the reference unit
			vectors (x,y,z) the six numbers will be [x' dot x, x' dot y, x' dot z, y' dot x, y' dot
			y, y' dot z] where "dot" is the scalar dot product (cosine of the angle between the unit
			vectors). The unit vectors in both the local and reference coordinates are right-handed
			and orthonormal.
			         
			The pair of groups NXtranslation and NXorientation together
			describe the position of a component.
