		Information recorded as a function of time.
		
		Description of information that is recorded against
		time. There are two common use cases for this:

		- When logging data such as temperature during a run
		- When data is taken in streaming mode data acquisition,
		  i.e. just timestamp, value pairs are stored and
		  correlated later in data reduction with other data, 

		
		It both cases NXlog contains 
		the logged or streamed  values and the times at which they were measured as elapsed time since a starting
		time recorded in ISO8601 format. The time units are
		specified in the units attribute. An optional scaling attribute
		can be used to accomodate non standard clocks. 

		
		This method of storing logged data helps to distinguish
		instances in which a variable is a dimension scale of the data, in which case it is stored
		in an :ref:`NXdata` group, and instances in which it is logged during the 
		run, when it should be stored in an :ref:`NXlog` group.

		In order to make random access to timestamped data faster there is an optional array pair of
		``cue_timestamp_zero`` and ``cue_index``. The ``cue_timestamp_zero`` will
		contain coarser timestamps than in the time array, say
		every five minutes. The ``cue_index`` will then contain the
		index into the time,value pair of arrays for that
		coarser ``cue_timestamp_zero``.
