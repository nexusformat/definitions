             The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
             Use the depends_on fields of the respective specialized
             :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set` base class surplus
             :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` with at least one instance of
             :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` to define explicitly the reference frame in
             which the primitives are defined.  Alternatively, although
             disencouraged, one may use one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` with
             with only one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` in the application definition
             to specify implicitly in which reference frame the primitives are
             defined.  If none of these two possibilities is used all primitives
             are assumed defined in the McStas coordinate system.

         Base class for a region-of-interest (ROI) bound by geometric primitives.
         
         So-called region-of-interest(s) (ROIs) are typically used to describe a
         region in space (and time) where an observation is made or for which
         a computer simulation is performed with given boundary conditions.
