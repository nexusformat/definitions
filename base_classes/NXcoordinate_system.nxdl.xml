        Base class to detail a coordinate system (CS).

        Instances of ``NXcoordinate_system`` can be used to describe coordinate systems
        other than the default `NeXus coordinate system &lt;https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#the-nexus-coordinate-system&gt;`_.

        Whenever possible, all instances of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
        should be used at the top-level (i.e, directly below ``NXentry``)
        within an application definition or within a NeXus file.

        ``NXcoordinate_system`` can be part of the transformations chain
        using :ref:`NXtransformations`, where it acts as a linear
        change-of-basis transformation (using a 3x3 matrix with the basis
        vectors ``x``, `y``, and ``z`` as columns).

        Any group that has an optional ``depends_on`` field or any field
        that has an optional ``depends_on`` attribute has a fallback when
        ``depends_on`` is not provided. The fallback behavior involves
        traversing up the hierarchy until the first parent that contains one
        and only one ``NXcoordinate_system`` group is found. If such a parent
        exists, its coordinate system applies. If none is found, then the
        current coordinate system is not defined with respect to anything
        else. As an example, if there is only one NXcoordinate_system called
        "my_coordinate_system" defined directly under ``NXentry``, each
        optional ``depends_on`` field/attribute that is not defined
        automatically defaults to ``depends_on=my_coordinate_system``.

        How many groups of type ``NXcoordinate_system`` should be used in
        an application definition?

        * 0; if there is no instance of ``NXcoordinate_system`` across the
          application definition or the data tree, you can use ``depends_on="."``
          to state that this transformation depends on the default
          `NeXus coordinate system &lt;https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#the-nexus-coordinate-system&gt;`_
          (which is the same as the one used by `McStas &lt;https://mcstas.org/&gt;`_).

          For the sake of clarity, even in this case it is better
          to be explicit like for every other coordinate system definition
          to support users with interpreting the content and logic behind
          every instance of the tree.

          The default NeXus coordinate system (i.e., the McStas coordinate
          system) can be expressed as follows:

          .. code-block::
                    
            mcstas@NXcoordinate_system
                x = [1, 0, 0]
                y = [0, 1, 0]
                z = [0, 0, 1]
                @y_direction = "opposite to gravity"
                @z_direction = "direction of the primary beam"

        * 1; if only one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` is defined, it should be
          placed as high up in the tree hierarchy (ideally right below an
          instance of NXentry) of the application definition tree as possible.
          This coordinate system shall be named such that it is clear how this
          coordinate system is typically referred to in a community. For the
          NeXus McStas coordinate system, it is advised to call it ``mcstas``
          for the sake of improved clarity.

          If this is the case, it is assumed that this ``NXcoordinate_system``
          overwrites the NeXus default McStas coordinate system, i.e. users
          can thereby conveniently and explicitly specify the
          coordinate system that they wish to use.

          This case has the advantage that it is explicit and offers no
          ambiguities. However, in reality typically multiple coordinate
          systems have to be mastered especially for complex multi-signal
          modality experiments.

          If this case is realized, the best practice is that in every
          case where this coordinate system should be referred to the respective
          group has a ``depends_on`` field, to clearly indicate which 
          specific coordinate systems is referred to.

        * 2 and more; as soon as more than one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system`
          is specified somewhere in the tree, different interpretations are
          possible as to which of these coordinate systems
          apply or take preference.
          While these ambiguities should be avoided if possible, the
          opportunity for multiples instances enables to have coordinate
          system conventions that are specific for some part of the NeXus
          tree. This is especially useful for deep groups where
          multiple scientific methods are combined or cases where having a
          definition of global conversion tables how to convert between
          representations in different coordinate systems is not desired
          or available for now.

          To resolve the possible ambiguities which specific coordinate systems 
          in an :ref:`NXtransformations` train is referred to, it is even more
          important to use the ``depends_on`` field in groups and the ``depends_on``
          attribute in NXtransformations to refer to one of the ``NXcoordinate_system``
          instances. 
         
          In the case of two or more instances of ``NXcoordinate_system`` it
          is advised to specify the relationship between the two coordinate
          systems by using the :ref:`NXtransformations` group within
          ``NXcoordinate_system``.

        In any case, users are encouraged to write explicit and clean
        ``depends_on`` fields in all groups that encode information for which
        the interpretation of coordinate systems and transformations is relevant.
        If these ``depends_on`` instances are not provided or no instance of
        ``NX_coordinate_system`` exists in the upper part of the hierarchy,
        the application definition is considered underconstrained. Note that this
        is the case for all files that were created before ``NXcoordinate_system``
        was added.
