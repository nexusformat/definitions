		Logical grouping of detectors. When used, describes a group of detectors.

		Each detector is represented as an NXdetector 
		with its own detector data array.  Each detector data array
		may be further decomposed into array sections by use of
		NXdetector_module groups.  Detectors can be grouped logically
		together using NXdetector_group. Groups can be further grouped
		hierarchically in a single NXdetector_group (for example, if
		there are multiple detectors at an endstation or multiple 
		endstations at a facility).  Alternatively, multiple 
		NXdetector_groups can be provided.

		The groups are defined hierarchically, with names given
		in the group_names field, unique identifying indices given
		in the field group_index, and the level in the hierarchy
		given in the group_parent field.  For example if an x-ray
		detector group, DET, consists of four detectors in a
		rectangular array::
						
				 DTL	DTR
				 DLL	DLR
						
		We could have::
					
			group_names: ["DET", "DTL", "DTR", "DLL", "DLR"]
		 	group_index: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		 	group_parent:  [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

            Declares which child group contains a path leading 
            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
