		Logical grouping of detector elements.
		
		This class is used to allow a logical
		grouping of detector elements (e.g. which tube, bank or group of banks) to be
		recorded in the file. As well as allowing you to e.g just select the "left" or
		"east" detectors, it may also be useful for determining which elements belong to the
		same PSD tube and hence have e.g. the same dead time.
		
		For example, if we had "bank1" composed
		of "tube1", "tube2" and "tube3" then group_names would be the string "bank1,
		bank1/tube1, bank1/tube2,bank1/tube3" group_index would be {1,2,3,4} group_parent
		would be {-1,1,1,1}
		
		The mapping array is interpreted as
		group 1 is a top level group containing groups 2, 3 and 4
		
		A ``group_index`` array in
		``NXdetector`` gives the base group for a detector element.
