		A literature reference
		
		Definition to include references for example for detectors,
		manuals, instruments, acquisition or analysis software used.
		
		The idea would be to include this in the relevant NeXus object:
		:ref:`NXdetector` for detectors, :ref:`NXinstrument` for instruments, etc.

            Declares which child group contains a path leading 
            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
