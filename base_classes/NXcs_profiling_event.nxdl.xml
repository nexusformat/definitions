            Wall-clock time how long the event took.
            
            This may be in principle end_time minus start_time; however usage of
            eventually more precise timers may warrant to use a finer temporal
            discretization, and thus demand for a more precise record of the
            wall-clock time.
            
            Elapsed time may contain time portions where resources were idling.

    <field name="max_processes" type="NX_UINT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
            The number of nominal processes that the app invoked during the execution of this event.
            
            The main idea behind this field e.g. for apps which use e.g. MPI
            (Message Passing Interface) parallelization is to communicate
            how many processes were used.
            
            For sequentially running apps number_of_processes and number_of_threads
            is one. If the app exclusively uses GPU parallelization, number_of_gpus
            can be larger than one. If no GPU is used, number_of_gpus is zero,
            even though the hardware may have GPUs installed.

            Specifically here the maximum number of threads used for the
            high-level threading library used (e.g. OMP_NUM_THREADS), posix.
