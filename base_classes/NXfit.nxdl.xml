                Often, if the peaks and fit backgrounds are defined independently (i.e, with their own
                parameter sets), the resulting global fit is a function of the form
                :math:`model = peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3).`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the
                set of parameters for one peak/background.

        <field name="description">
            <doc>
                Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
                Examples:

                - least squares
                - non-linear least squares
                - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)
                - linear regression

            </doc>
        </field>
        <field name="formula_description">
            <doc>
                For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the ``global_fit_function`` given above.
                As an example, for a least squares algorithm on independent components, the formula of the ``error_function``
                would be :math:`LLS(peak_1(p_1) + peak_2(p_2) + backgr(p_3))`, where each :math:`p_i` describes the set
                of parameters for one peak/background. In this case, the ``formula_description`` can be expressed as
                :math:`min(\chi^2)`, where :math:`\chi^2` is the sum of squared residuals between the model and the
                observed data:
                :math:`min(\chi^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \left( \text{peak}_1(p_1, x_i) + \text{peak}_2(p_2, x_i) + \text{backgr}(p_3, x_i) \right) \right)^2`

                It is however also possible to supply more involved formulas (e.g., in the case of constrained fits).
