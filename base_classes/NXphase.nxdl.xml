<definition xmlns="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" category="base" type="group" name="NXphase" extends="NXobject" xsi:schemaLocation="http://definition.nexusformat.org/nxdl/3.1 ../nxdl.xsd">
    <doc>
        Base class to describe a (thermodynamic) phase as a component of a material.
        
        Instances of phases can be crystalline.
    </doc>
    <field name="phase_id" type="NX_INT" units="NX_UNITLESS">
        <doc>
            Identifier for each phase.
            
            The value 0 is reserved for the unknown phase that represents the
            null-model (no sufficiently significant information available).
            In other words, the phase_name is n/a aka notIndexed.
            
            The identifier_phase value should match with the integer suffix of the
            group name which represents that instance in a NeXus/HDF5 file, i.e.
            if three phases were used e.g. 0, 1, and 2, three instances of
            :ref:`NXphase` named phase0, phase1, and phase2 should be stored
            in that HDF5 file.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="name" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
            Given name as an alias for identifying this phase.
            
            If the identifier_phase is 0 and one would like to use
            the field name, the value should be n/a or notIndexed.
