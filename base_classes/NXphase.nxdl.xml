         Base class to describe a (thermodynamic) phase as a component of a material.
        
        Instances of phases can be crystalline.

             Identifier for each phase.
             
             The value 0 is reserved for the unknown phase that represents the
             null-model no sufficiently significant confirmation. In other words,
             the phase_name is n/a aka notIndexed.
             
             The phase identifier value has to match with the integer postfix of the
             group name which represents that instance in a NeXus/HDF5 file, i.e.
             if two phases were used e.g. 0 and 1, two instances of :ref:`NXphase`
             named phase0 and phase1 should be stored in that HDF5 file.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="name" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Given name as an alias for identifying this phase.
             
             If the phase_identifier is 0 and one would like to used
             the field name the value should be n/a or notIndexed.
