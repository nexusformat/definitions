         Base class to detail the marching cubes (MC) algorithm.
         
         Documenting which specific version of MC was used helps with understanding
         how robust the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.

             Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.

             MC implementations:

    <!--we could also think about storing the rule sets in here explicitly including the
coordinate system conventions; however, the problem is that many commercial
tools like Matlab do not expose the rule set.-->
