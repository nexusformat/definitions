    <doc>
         Computational geometry description of the marching cubes algorithm.
         
         Documenting which specific version was used helps with understanding how
         robust the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.

    <group name="grid" type="NXcg_grid">
        <doc>
             Reference/link to and/or details of the grid on which a specific
             marching cubes algorithm implementation is operating.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <field name="implementation" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.
             
             See for example the following papers for details about how to identify a
             DOI which specifies the implementation used:
             
             * `W. E. Lorensen &lt;https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2020.2971284&gt;`_
             * `T. S. Newman and H. Yi &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021&gt;`_
             
             The value placed here should be a DOI. If there are no specific DOI or
             details write not_further_specified, or give at least a free-text
             description.
        </doc>

    <!--we could also think about storing the rule sets in here explicitly including the
coordinate system conventions; however, the problem is that many commercial
tools like Matlab do not expose the rule set.-->
