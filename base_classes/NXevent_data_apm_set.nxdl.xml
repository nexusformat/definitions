         Base class for a set of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm` instances.
         
         Members of the set are instances of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm`.
         These have an associated time interval during which the conditions
         of the instrument were considered stable and fit enough for purpose.
         
         Which temporal granularity is adequate depends on the situation and research
         question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers the most
         flexible way to cater for both atom probe experiments or  simulation.
         
         To monitor the course of an ion extraction experiment (or simulation)
         it makes sense to track time explicitly via time stamps or implicitly
         via e.g. a clock inside the instrument, such as the clock of the pulser
         and respective pulsing event identifier.
         
         As set and measured quantities typically change over time and we do not
         yet know during the measurement which of the events have associated
         (molecular) ions that will end up in the reconstructed volume, we must not
         document quantities as a function of the evaporated_identifier but as a
         function of the (pulsing) event_identifier.
