         Computational geometry description of a set of points.
         
         Points may have an associated time value. Users are advised though to store
         time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where for each
         point in time there is an :ref:`NXcg_point_set` instance which specifies the
         points' locations.
         
         This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer simulations, where
         positions of points are taken at the same point in time (real time or
         simulated physical time). Thereby, the storage of redundant time stamp
         information per point is considered as obsolete.
