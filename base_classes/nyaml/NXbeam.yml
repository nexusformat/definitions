  Properties of the neutron or X-ray beam at a given location. 
        
  It will be referenced by beamline component groups within the :ref:`NXinstrument` group or by the :ref:`NXsample` group. 
  Note that variables such as the incident energy could be scalar values or arrays. 
  This group is especially valuable in storing the results of instrument simulations in which it is useful to specify the beam profile, 
  time distribution etc. at each beamline component. 
  Otherwise, its most likely use is in the :ref:`NXsample` group in which it defines the results of the neutron
  scattering by the sample, e.g., energy transfer, polarizations.

      In the case of a monchromatic beam this is the scalar energy.
      Several other use cases are permitted, depending on the presence of other incident_energy_X fields.

      * In the case of a polychromatic beam this is an array of length m of energies, with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights.
      * In the case of a monochromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot, this is an array of energies, one for each recorded shot. 
        Here, incident_energy_weights and incident_energy_spread are not set.
      * In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot, 
        this is an array of length m with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights as a 2D array.
      * In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot and where the channels also vary,
        this is a 2D array of dimensions nP by m (slow to fast) with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights as a 2D array.

      Note, variants are a good way to represent several of these use cases in a single dataset,
      e.g. if a calibrated, single-value energy value is available along with the original spectrum from which it was calibrated.

        Responsibility on correct formatting and parsing is handed to the user by using 'NX_ANY'.
        Correct parsing can still be implemented by using this attribute.

      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
