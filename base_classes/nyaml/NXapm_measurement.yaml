  Base class for collecting a run with a real or a simulated atom probe or field-ion microscope.
  
  The term run is understood as an exact synonym for session, i.e. the usage of a real or simulated
  tomograph or microscope for a certain amount of time during which one characterizes a single specimen.
  
  Research workflows for experiments and simulations of atom probe and related field-evaporation
  evolve continuously and become increasingly connected with other methods used for material
  characterization specifically electron microscopy. A few examples in this direction are:
  
  * `T. Kelly et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620022205>`_
  * `C. Fleischmann et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_
  * `W. Windl et al. <https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozad067.294>`_
  * `C. Freysoldt et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.176801>`_
  * `G. da Costa et al. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54169-2>`_
  
  The majority of atom probe research is performed using the so-called Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) instruments
  from AMETEK/Cameca. In addition, several research groups have built their own instruments and shared different
  aspects of the technical specifications and approaches including how these groups apply data processing e.g.:
  
  * `M. Monajem et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927622003397>`_
  * `P. Stender et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621013982>`_
  * `I. Dimkou et al. <https://doi.org/10.1093/micmic/ozac051>`_
