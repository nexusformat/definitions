  (**required**) ':'ref':'`NXentry` describes the measurement.
  
  The top-level NeXus group which contains all the data and associated
  information that comprise a single measurement.
  It is mandatory that there is at least one
  group of this type in the NeXus file.

      Declares which ':'ref':'`NXdata` group contains the data
      to be shown by default.
      It is used to resolve ambiguity when
      one ':'ref':'`NXdata` group exists.
      The value ':'ref':'`names <validItemName>` a child group.  If that group
      itself has a ``default`` attribute, continue this chain until an
      ':'ref':'`NXdata` group is reached.
      
      For more information about how NeXus identifies the default
      plottable data, see the
      ':'ref':'`Find Plottable Data, v3 <Find-Plottable-Data-v3>`
      section.

      The data group
      
      .. note':'':' Before the NIAC2016 meeting [#]_, at least one
         ':'ref':'`NXdata` group was required in each ':'ref':'`NXentry` group.
         At the NIAC2016 meeting, it was decided to make ':'ref':'`NXdata`
         an optional group in ':'ref':'`NXentry` groups for data files that
         do not use an application definition.
         It is recommended strongly that all NeXus data files provide
         a NXdata group.
         It is permissable to omit the NXdata group only when
         defining the default plot is not practical or possible
         from the available data.
      
         For example, neutron event data may not have anything that
         makes a useful plot without extensive processing.
      
         Certain application definitions override this decision and
         require an ':'ref':'`NXdata` group
         in the ':'ref':'`NXentry` group.  The ``minOccurs=0`` attribute
         in the application definition will indicate the
         ':'ref':'`NXdata` group
         is optional, otherwise, it is required.

      Official NeXus NXDL schema to which this entry conforms which must be
      the name of the NXDL file (case sensitive without the file extension)
      that the NXDL schema is defined in.
      
      For example the ``definition`` field for a file that conformed to the
      *NXarpes.nxdl.xml* definition must contain the string **NXarpes**.
      
      This field is provided so that ':'ref':'`NXentry` can be the overlay position
      in a NeXus data file for an application definition and its
      set of groups, fields, and attributes.
      
      *It is advised* to use ':'ref':'`NXsubentry`, instead, as the overlay position.

      which gives the T0 signal to the detector electronics. If another component in the
      NXinstrument hierarchy provides this information, this should be a link.
