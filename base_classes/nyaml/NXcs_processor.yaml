  Base class for reporting the description of processing units of a computer.
  
  Examples are e.g. classical so-called central processing units (CPUs),
  coprocessors, graphic cards, accelerator processing units or a system of these.

NXcs_processor(NXcomponent):
  (NXcircuit):
    doc: |
      Typical examples for the granularization of processing units are:
      
      * A desktop computer with a single CPU; describe using one instance of NXcircuit.
      * A dual-socket server; describe using two instances of NXcircuit.
      * A server with two dual-socket server nodes; describe with four
        instances of NXcircuit surplus a field that defines their level
        in the hierarchy.
    type(NX_CHAR):

        General type of the processing unit e.g.
        
        * pu, processing core or hyper-threading core
        * cpu, (multi-)core central processing unit
        * gpu, (multi-)core general purpose processing unit
        * fpga, field programmable gate array
      enumeration:
        open_enum: true
        items: [pu, cpu, gpu, fpga]
    clock_speed(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        Clock speed of the circuit
