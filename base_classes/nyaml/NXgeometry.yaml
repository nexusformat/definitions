  legacy class - recommend to use :ref:`NXtransformations` now
  
  It is recommended that instances of :ref:`NXgeometry` be converted to
  use :ref:`NXtransformations`.
  
  This is the description for a general position of a component.
  It is recommended to name an instance of :ref:`NXgeometry` as "geometry"
  to aid in the use of the definition in simulation codes such as McStas.
  Also, in HDF, linked items must share the same name.
  However, it might not be possible or practical in all situations.
type: group
deprecated: as decided at 2014 NIAC meeting, convert to use :ref:`NXtransformations`

      Optional description/label. Probably only present if we are
      an additional reference point for components rather than the
      location of a real component.
  component_index(NX_INT):

      Position of the component along the beam path. The sample is at 0, components upstream
      have negative component_index, components downstream have positive
      component_index.
