      * A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element symbol + count).
      * Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the multiplier for the
        group must follow the closing parentheses. That is, all element and group
        multipliers are assumed to be printed as subscripted numbers.
      * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to their chemical
        structure, the order of the elements within any group or moiety depends on
        whether or not carbon is present.

  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |       
      NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
      to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
      is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
      field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
      string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
      NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |       
      This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
      and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
      the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
      other component groups.
