      .. index:: plotting
            
      Declares which child group contains a path leading 
      to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
      See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
      for a summary of the discussion.
