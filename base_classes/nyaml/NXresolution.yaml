  Describes the resolution of a physical quantity.
type: group
NXresolution(NXobject):
  physical_quantity:
    doc: |
      The physical quantity of the resolution, e.g.,
      energy, momentum, time, area, etc.
  type:
    doc: |
      The process by which the resolution was determined.
    enumeration: [estimated, derived, calibrated, other]
  note(NXnote):
    doc: |
      Additional details of the estimate or description of the calibration procedure
  resolution(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      The resolution of the physical quantity.
  resolution_errors(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Standard deviation of the resolution of the physical quantity.
  relative_resolution(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Ratio of the resolution at a specified measurand value to that measurand value.
  relative_resolution_errors(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
    doc: |
      Standard deviation of the relative resolution of the physical quantity.
  response_function(NXdata):
    doc: |
      The response of the instrument or part of the instrument to a infinitesimally sharp input signal
      along the physical quantity of this group.
      This is also sometimes called instrument response function for time resolution or
      point spread function for spatial response.
      The resolution is typically determined by taking the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
      of the response function.
      
      This could have an AXISNAME field ```input``` (the input axis or grid of the response function)
      and a ``DATA`` field ```magnitude```. Both of these should have the same unit. The dimensions
      should match those of the :ref:`resolution </NXresolution/resolution-field>` field.
  formula_symbols(NXparameters):
    doc: |
      Symbols linking to another path in the NeXus tree to be referred to from the
      `resolution_formula_description` field. The ``TERM``  should be a valid path inside this application
      definition, i.e., of the form /entry/instrument/my_part/my_field.
  resolution_formula_description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A description of the resolution formula to determine the resolution from a set of symbols as
      entered by the `formula_...` fields. This should be an english description of the math used.
  (NXcalibration):
    doc: |
      For storing details and data of a calibration to derive a resolution from data.
