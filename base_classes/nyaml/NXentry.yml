  (**required**) :ref:`NXentry` describes the measurement. 

  The top-level NeXus group which contains all the data and associated
  information that comprise a single measurement. 
  It is mandatory that there is at least one
  group of this type in the NeXus file.

      .. index:: plotting

      Declares which :ref:`NXdata` (or :ref:`NXsubentry`) group 
      contains the data to be shown by default.
      It is needed to resolve ambiguity when more than one :ref:`NXdata` group exists. 
      The value is the name of the default :ref:`NXdata` group.

      It is recommended (as of NIAC2014 [#]_) to use this attribute
      to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.

      The data group

      .. note:: Before the NIAC2016 meeting [#]_, at least one
         :ref:`NXdata` group was required in each :ref:`NXentry` group.
         At the NIAC2016 meeting, it was decided to make :ref:`NXdata` 
         an optional group in :ref:`NXentry` groups for data files that 
         do not use an application definition.
         It is recommended strongly that all NeXus data files provide 
         a NXdata group.  
         It is permissable to omit the NXdata group only when 
         defining the default plot is not practical or possible
         from the available data.
         
         For example, neutron event data may not have anything that 
         makes a useful plot without extensive processing.
         
         Certain application definitions override this decision and
         require an :ref:`NXdata` group
         in the :ref:`NXentry` group.  The ``minOccurs=0`` attribute
         in the application definition will indicate the 
         :ref:`NXdata` group
         is optional, otherwise, it is required.
