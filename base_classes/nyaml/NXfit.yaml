          The ``input_independent`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)

  peakPEAK(NXpeak):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      An instance of the peak model.

    total_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Total area under the curve (can also be used for the total area minus any
        background values).
    relative_sensitivity_factor(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
      doc: |
        Relative sensitivity for this peak, to be used for quantification in
        an NXprocess.
        
        As an example, in X-ray spectroscopy could depend on the energy scale
        (see position), the ionization cross section, and the element probed.
    relative_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Relative area of this peak compared to other peaks.
        
        The relative area can simply be derived by dividing the total_area by the
        total area of all peaks or by a more complicated method (e.g., by
        additionally dividing by the relative sensitivity factors). Details shall
        be given in `global_fit_function`.
  backgroundBACKGROUND(NXpeak):
    nameType: partial
    doc: |
      One fitted background (functional form, position (see :ref:`data/input_independent </NXfit/data/input_independent-field>`),
      and intensities) of the peak fit.
      If there is no characteristic name for each background component, it is envisioned that backgrounds are labeled
      as background_0, background_1, and so on.
  global_fit_function(NXfit_function):
    doc: |
      Function used to describe the overall fit to the data, taking into account the parameters of the
      individual :ref:`NXpeak` components.
    formula_description:
      doc: |
        Often, if the peaks and fit backgrounds are defined independently (i.e, with their own
        parameter sets), the resulting global fit is a function of the form
        :math:`model = peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3).`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the
        set of parameters for one peak/background.
  error_function(NXfit_function):
    doc: |
      Function used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
    description:
      doc: |
        Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
        Examples:
        
        - least squares
        - nonlinear least squares
        - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)
        - linear regression
        - Bayesian linear regression
    formula_description:
      doc: |
        For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the ``global_fit_function`` given above.
        As an example, for a least squares algorithm on independent components, the formula of the ``error_function``
        would be :math:`LLS(peak_1(p_1) + peak_2(p_2) + backgr(p_3))`, where each :math:`p_i` describes the set
        of parameters for one peak/background. In this case, the ``formula_description`` can be expressed as
        :math:`min(\chi^2)`, where :math:`\chi^2` is the sum of squared residuals between the model and the
        observed data:
        :math:`min(\chi^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \left( \text{peak}_1(p_1, x_i) + \text{peak}_2(p_2, x_i) + \text{backgr}(p_3, x_i) \right) \right)^2`
        
        It is however also possible to supply more involved formulas (e.g., in the case of constrained fits).
  figure_of_meritMETRIC(NX_NUMBER):
    nameType: partial
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Figure-of-merit to determine the goodness of fit, i.e., how well the fit model (i.e., the set of peaks and backgrounds)
      fits the measured observations.
      
      This value (which is a single number) is often used to guide adjustments to the
      fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.
    \@metric:
      doc: |
        Metric used to determine the goodness of fit. Examples include:
        
        - :math:`\chi^2`, the squared sum of the sigma-weighted residuals
        - reduced :math:`\chi^2`:, :math:`\chi^2`: per degree of freedom
        - :math:`R^2`, the coefficient of determination
