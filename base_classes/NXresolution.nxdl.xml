    <group name="response_function" type="NXdata">
        <doc>
             The response of the instrument or part of the instrument to a infinitesimally sharp input signal
             along the physical quantity of this group.
             This is also sometimes called instrument response function for time resolution or
             point spread function for spatial response.
             The resolution is typically determined by taking the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
             of the response function.

             This could have an AXISNAME field ```input``` (the input axis or grid of the response function)
             and a ``DATA`` field ```magnitude```. Both of these should have the same unit. The dimensions
             should match those of the :ref:`resolution &lt;/NXresolution/resolution-field&gt;` field.

            definition, i.e., of the form /entry/instrument/my_part/my_field.

             to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
             
             It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
             to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
