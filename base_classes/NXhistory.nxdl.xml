    <doc>
         A set of activities that occurred to a physical entity prior/during experiment.
         
         Ideally, a full report of the previous operations (or links to a chain of operations).
         Alternatively, notes allow for additional descriptors in any format.
    </doc>
    <group type="NXactivity" minOccurs="1">
        <doc>
             Any activity that was performed on the physical entity prior or during the experiment.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <field name="identifierNAME" nameType="partial">
        <doc>
             An ID or reference to the location or a unique (globally
             persistent) identifier of e.g. another file which gives
             as many as possible details of the history event.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <group type="NXnote" nameType="any">
        <doc>
             A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the physical entity before or during the
             experiment (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively, a
             reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In the
             case these are not available, free-text description.
             This should only be used in case that there is no rigorous description
             using the base classes above. This group can also be used to pull in any activities
             that are not well described by an existing base class definition.

             Any number of instances of NXnote are allowed for describing extra details of
             this activity.
