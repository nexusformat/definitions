        Base class for packing and unpacking booleans.
        
        The field mask should be constructed from packing a vector of booleans
        (a bitfield) into unsigned integers with bytesize bitdepth. Padding to
        an integer number of such integers is assumed.
        
        Thereby, this base class can be used to inform software about necessary modulo
        operations to decode the mask to recover e.g. set membership of objects in sets
        whose membership has been encoded as a vector of booleans.
        
        This is useful e.g. when processing object sets such as point cloud data.
        If e.g. a spatial filter has been applied to a set of points, we may wish to document
        memory-space efficiently which points were analyzed. An array of boolean values
        is one option to achieve this. A value is true if the point is included and false otherwise.

            Possibility to refer to which set this mask applies.
            
            If depends_on is not provided, it is assumed that the mask
            applies to its direct parent.
