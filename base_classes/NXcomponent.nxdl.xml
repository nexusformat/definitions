            Ideally, use instances of ``identifierNAME`` to point to a resource
            that provides further details.
 
            If such a resource does not exist or should not be used, use this free text,
            although it is not recommended.

            Instance or list of instances of ``NXcomponent`` (or base classes

            component.

            Each input should point to the path of the group acting as input.

            An example usage would be to chain components and/or beams together to describe
            the beam path in an experiment.

            Specifies the position of the component by pointing to the last
            transformation in the transformation chain that is defined
            via the NXtransformations group.

            NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
            to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
            is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
            field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
            string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
            NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

        <doc>
            Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the

            chain may however traverse similar groups in other component groups.
