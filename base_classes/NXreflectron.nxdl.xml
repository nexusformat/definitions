         Device for reducing flight time differences of ions in ToF experiments.
         For atom probe the reflectron can be considered an energy_compensation
         device, which can e.g. be realized technically as via a Poschenrieder lens
         (see US patent 3863068 or US patents for the reflectron 6740872, or the curved reflectron 8134119 design).

        <doc>
             Free-text field to specify further details about the reflectron.
             The field can be used to inform e. g. if the reflectron is flat or curved.

    <group type="NXtransformations">
        <doc>
             Affine transformation(s) which detail where the reflectron
             is located relative to e.g. the origin of the specimen space
             reference coordinate system.
             This group can also be used for specifying how the reflectron
             is rotated relative to the specimen axis.
             The purpose of these more detailed instrument descriptions
             is to support the creation of a digital twin of the instrument
             for computational science.
