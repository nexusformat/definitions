        Base class for method-specific generic imaging with electron microscopes.
        
        In the majority of cases simple d-dimensional regular scan patterns are used
        to probe regions-of-interest (ROIs). Examples can be single point aka spot
        measurements, line profiles, or (rectangular) surface mappings.
        The latter pattern is the most frequently used.
        
        For now the base class provides for scans for which the settings,
        binning, and energy resolution is the same for each scan point.
