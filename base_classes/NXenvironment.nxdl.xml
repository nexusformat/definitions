            NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
            to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
            is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
            field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
            string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
            NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

            This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
            and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
            the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
            other component groups.
