             This is to be used if there is no actuator/sensor that controls/measures
             the environment parameters, but the user would still like to give a value for
             it. An example would be a room temperature experiment where the temperature is
             not actively measured, but rather estimated.

             Note that this method for recording the environment parameters is not advised,
             but using NXsensor and NXactuator is strongly recommended instead.

            NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
            to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
            is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
            field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
            string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
            NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

        <doc>
            This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
            and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
            the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
            other component groups.
