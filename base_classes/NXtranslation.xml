This is the description for the general spatial location
of a component - it is used by the NXgeometry.xml class

    <distances type="NX_FLOAT[numobj,3]" units="">{(x,y,z)}{This field and the angle field describe the position of a component. For absolute position, the origin is the scattering center (where a perfectly aligned sample would be) with the z-axis pointing downstream and the y-axis pointing gravitationally up. For a relative position the NXtranslation is taken into account before the NXorientation. The axes are right-handed and orthonormal.}?</distances>
