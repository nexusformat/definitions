        Base class to store state and (meta)data of events for electron microscopy.
        
        Event-related (meta)data, typically measured datasets like images and spectra.
        To avoid repetitively storing static instrument-related metadata,
        the dynamic (meta)data that typically changes for each image and spectrum
        is split from the static (meta)data.
        
        Which temporal granularity is adequate to log events depends on the situation and
        research question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers
        the most flexible way to cater for both experiments with controlled electron
        beams in a real microscope or the simulation of such experiments or
        individual aspects of such experiments.
        
        Electron microscopes are dynamic. Scientists often report that microscopes
        *perform differently* across sessions. That *they* perform differently from
        one day or another. In some cases, root causes for performance differences
        are unclear. Users of the instrument may consider such conditions impractical,
        or *too poor*, and thus abort their session. Alternatively, users may try to
        bring the microscope into a state where conditions are considered better
        or of whatever high enough quality for starting or continuing the measurement.
        
        In all these use cases it is useful to have a mechanism whereby time-dependent
        data of the instrument state can be stored and documented in an representation
        that facilitates interoperability. This is the idea behind this base class.
        
        :ref:`NXem_event_data` represents an instance to describe and serialize flexibly
        whatever is considered a time interval during which the instrument is
        considered stable enough for allowing any working on tasks with it.
        Examples of such tasks are the collecting of data (images and spectra) or
        the calibrating the instrument or individual of its components. Users may wish to take
        only a single scan or image and complete their session thereafter.
        Alternatively, users are working for much longer time at the instrument,
        perform recalibrations in between and take several scans (of different
        ROIs on the specimen), or they explore the state of the microscope for
        service or maintenance tasks.
        
        :ref:`NXem_event_data` serves the harmonization and documentation of these cases:
        
        * Firstly, via a header section whose purpose is to contextualize
          and identify the event instance in time.
        * Secondly, via a data and metadata section where individual data
          collections can be stored in a standardized representation.
        
        We are aware of the fact that given the variety how an electron microscope
        is used, there is a need for a flexible and adaptive documentation system.
        At the same time we are also convinced though that just because one has
        different requirements for some specific aspect under the umbrella of settings
        to an electron microscope, this does not necessarily warrant that one has to
        cook up an own data schema.
        
        Instead, the electron microscopy community should work towards reusing schema
        components as frequently as possible. This will enable that there is at all
        not only a value of harmonizing electron microscopy research content but also
        there is a technical possibility to build services around such harmonized data.
        
        Arguably it is oftentimes tricky to specify a clear time interval when the
        microscope is *stable enough*. Take for instance the acquisition of an image
        or a stack of spectra. Having to deal with instabilities is a common theme in
        electron microscopy practice. Numerical protocols can be used during data
        post-processing to correct for some of the instabilities.
        A few exemplar references provide an overview on the subject:
        
        * `C. Ophus et al. &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.12.002&gt;`_
        * `B. Berkels et al. &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.12.016&gt;`_
        * `L. Jones et al. &lt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40679-015-0008-4&gt;`_
        
        For specific simulation purposes, mainly in an effort to digitally repeat or simulate
        the experiment (digital twin), it is tempting to consider dynamics of the instrument,
        implemented as time-dependent functional descriptions of e.g. lens excitations,
        beam shape functions, trajectories of groups of electrons and ions, or detector noise models.
        This also warrants to document the time-dependent details of individual components
        of the microscope via the here implemented class :ref:`NXem_event_data`.

        <doc>
            ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
            when the snapshot time interval started.
            
            If users wish to specify an interval of time that the snapshot should represent
            during which the instrument was stable and configured using specific settings and
            calibrations, the start_time is the start (left bound of the time interval) while
            the end_time specifies the end (right bound) of the time interval.

            * Dark_field, image, crystal defects

            * Cathodoluminescence (optical spectra)
            * Ronchigram, image, alignment utility specifically in TEM
            * Chamber, e.g. TV camera inside the chamber, education purposes.
            
            This field may also be used for storing additional information
            about the event for which there is at the moment no other place.
            
            In the long run such free-text field description should be avoided as
            it is difficult to machine-interpret. Instead, an enumeration should
            be used.
