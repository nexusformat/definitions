        Base class to report on the characterization of an area or volume of material.
        
        This area or volume of material is considered a region-of-interest (ROI).
        
        This base class should be used when the characterization was achieved by
        processing data from experiment or computer simulations into models of
        the microstructure of the material and the properties of the material or its
        crystal defects within this ROI. Microstructural features is a narrow synonym
        for these crystal defects.
        
        This base class can also be used to store data and metadata of the
        representation of the ROI, i.e. its discretization and shape.
        
        Methods from computational geometry are typically used for
        defining a discretization of the area and volume.
        
        Do not confuse this base class with :ref:`NXregion`. The purpose
        of the :ref:`NXregion` base class is to document data access i.e.
        I/O pattern on arrays. Therefore, concepts from :ref:`NXregion` operate
        in data space rather than in real or simulated real space.
