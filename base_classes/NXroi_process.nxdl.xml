        Base class to report on the characterization of an area or volume of material.
        
        This area or volume of material is considered a region-of-interest (ROI).
        
        This base class should be used when the characterization was achieved by
        processing data from experiment or computer simulations into models of
        the microstructure of the material and the properties of the material or its
        microstructural features (crystal defects) within this ROI.
        
        This base class can also be used to store data and metadata of the
        representation of the ROI, i.e. its discretization and shape.
        
        Methods from computational geometry are typically used for
        defining a discretization of the area and volume.
        
        Do not confuse this base class with :ref:`NXregion`. The purpose
        of the :ref:`NXregion` base class is to document data access (i.e.)
        I/O pattern on arrays, i.e. concepts from :ref:`NXregion` operate
        in data space not in real or simulated real space.
