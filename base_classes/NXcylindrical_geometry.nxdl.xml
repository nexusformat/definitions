  <doc>
    Geometry description for cylindrical shapes.
    This class can be used in place of ``NXoff_geometry`` when an exact
    representation for cylinders is preferred.
    For example, for Helium-tube, neutron detectors.
    It can be used to describe the shape of any beamline component, including detectors.
    In the case of detectors it can be used to define the shape of a single pixel, or,
    if the pixel shapes are non-uniform, to describe the shape of the whole detector.

  <field name="vertices" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">

    <doc>
      List of x,y,z coordinates for vertices.
      The origin of the coordinates is the position of the parent component, for
      example the NXdetector which the geometry describes.
      If the shape describes a single pixel for a detector with uniform pixel shape
      then the origin is the position of each pixel as described by the
      ``x/y/z_pixel_offset`` datasets in ``NXdetector``.

  <field name="cylinders" type="NX_INT">

    <doc>
      List of indices of vertices in the ``vertices`` dataset to form each cylinder.
      Each cylinder is described by three vertices A, B, C.
      First vertex A lies on the cylinder axis and circular face, second point B
      on edge of the same face as A, and third point C at the other face and on axis.

            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
