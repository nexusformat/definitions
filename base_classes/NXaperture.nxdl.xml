        NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
        to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
        is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
        field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
        string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
        NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

        The reference point of the aperture is its center in the x and y axis. The reference point on the z axis is the
        surface of the aperture pointing towards the source.

        In complex (asymmetic) geometries an NXoff_geometry group can be used to provide an unambiguous reference.

        This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
        and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
        the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
        other component groups.

            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
