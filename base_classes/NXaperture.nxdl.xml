        Points to the path to a field defining the last transformation in a chain of transformations
        which defines the position and orientation of this component or the string "." if located
        in the origin.

        The reference point of the aperture is its center in the x and y axis. The reference point on the z axis is the
        surface of the aperture pointing towards the source.

        In complex (asymmetic) geometries an NXoff_geometry group can be used to provide an unambiguous reference.

            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
