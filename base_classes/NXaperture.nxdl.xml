    NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations 
    to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations 
    is critical and form a what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on 
    field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain. 
    Usually these operations are stored in a NXtransformations group. But NeXus 
    allows them to be stored anywhere.

      <doc>
    This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation 
    and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
    the instrument.

            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
