	<doc>
		Goniometer rotation angles and sample translations used during a
		measurement. The goniometers used at neutron and x-ray
		facilities are typically four-circle or six-circle goniometers,
		or variants of either one. There is no universally recognized
		naming convention for angles and translations, so the group
		should contain a :ref:`NXcite` group, which describes how the
		angles are defined.
	</doc>

    <group name="convention" type="NXcite">
        <doc>
            A reference to a publication or online documentation that
            describe the convention used in this group to define the
            names of angles and sample translations.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <field name="goniometer">
        <doc>
            The common name for the type of goniometer used in these
            measurements.
        </doc>
    </field>
	<field name="ROTATION_ANGLE" type="NX_FLOAT" units="NX_ANGLE" nameType="any">
        <doc>
            One of the goniometer rotation angles defined by the
            specified convention.

    </field>
    <field name="SAMPLE_TRANSLATION" type="NX_FLOAT" units="NX_LENGTH" nameType="any">
        <doc>
            The translation of the sample from the centre of rotation of
            the goniometer angles along one of the coordinate axes.
