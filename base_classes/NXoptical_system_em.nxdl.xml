    <!--NEW ISSUE: for now used to store difficult to place entries
NEW ISSUE: all the definitions here should better be backed up by the
work of the HMC EM glossary activities-->
    <field name="camera_length" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is *an effective distance from a specimen
             to a plane where an observed diffraction pattern is formed*.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="magnification" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_DIMENSIONLESS">
        <doc>
             The factor of enlargement of the apparent size, not physical size, of an object.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="defocus" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             The defocus aberration constant oftentimes taken as the C_1_0 which
             is described in more details in NXaberration.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="semi_convergence_angle" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_ANGLE">
        <doc>
             Citing the JEOL TEM glosssary this is the value *when a cone shaped,
             convergent electron beam illuminates a specimen, the semi-angle of the cone
             is termed convergence angle.*
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="field_of_view" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             The extent of the observable parts of the specimen given the current
             magnification and other settings of the instrument.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="working_distance" type="NX_FLOAT" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Citing `Globalsino &lt;https://www.globalsino.com/EM/page4586.html&gt;`_ this is
             *a distance between the specimen and the lower pole piece in SEM system*.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="beam_current" type="NX_FLOAT" units="NX_CURRENT">
        <doc>
             Beam current as measured relevant for the illumination of the specimen.
             Users should specify further details like how the beam current was measured
             using the beam_current_description field.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="beam_current_description">
        <doc>
             Specify further details how the beam current was measured or estimated.
        </doc>
    </field>

adding of the image_mode or field mode
imageMode: enum: [normal_image, sad, eds, nbd, cbed]
