## NeXus definition developers

After making a change to the NeXus class definitions there are two important checks
to be made before commiting the change:

 1. check whether the change does not violate any syntax rules
 2. verify whether the change looks as intended in the HTML documentation

First install the test and build requirements with this command (only run once)

    make install

Then verify syntax and build the HTML manual with this command

    make local

Open the HTML manual in a web brower for visual verification

    firefox build/manual/build/html/index.html

### HTML pages with contributor information

To build the html pages that contains contributor information on the sidebar set a github access token to an environment variable called GH_TOKEN.

Note: If set this will increase the build time of the documentation by approximately a factor of 4.

    setenv GH_TOKEN <access token>

### Working with nyaml files

There exists a simplified format of nxdl, which is called nyaml.
There is a [tool](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nyaml) (`nyaml2nxdl`) available to convert between nxdl and nyaml.
This tool is already installed when you installed the requirements for this repository and it is conveniently available from the make command.

You can build nyaml files for all nxdl files with invoking

    make nyaml

which will created `.yaml` files in a subfolder called `nyaml` in the respective directory.

From this you can do your changes and create nxdl files with

    make nxdl

from the yaml files.
