<div><details class="summary-application-definition-for-real-or-simulated-atom-probe-and-field-ion-microscopy">
<summary>Application definition for real or simulated atom probe and field-ion microscopy ...</summary><p>Application definition for real or simulated atom probe and field-ion microscopy experiments.</p>
<p>Atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy are methods for characterizing materials
through induced controlled extraction of individual atoms as ions and molecular ions from
a sharp needle-shaped specimen.</p>
<p>Offering isotopic and nanometer-scale resolution, atom probe data enable quantification of
local chemical composition and computing of volumetric reconstructions which are models for
the atomic architecture of the small specimen volume analyzed. These reconstructions provide
input for characterization of atomic segregation at crystal defects. The term microstructural features
is considered as a narrow synonym for crystal defects.</p>
<p>The aim of the NXapm application definition is to provide a general yet specific enough
solution to serialize artifacts for virtually all atom probe and field-ion microscopy experiments.</p>
<p>Before summarizing the design of the base classes and the parts of the NXapm application definition,
it is worthwhile to recall and distinguish concepts that are related to atom extraction
events and the molecular ions that are frequently generated by the sequence of events:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An atom probe instrument uses laser or voltage pulsing events to trigger ion extraction events.</p></li>
<li><p>These ions are accelerated in an electric field towards a position-sensitive detector system.
Physical events and corresponding signal on this detector is triggered by an ion hitting the detector.
Some of these events are not necessarily caused by or directly correlated with an identifiable pulsing event.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that only a part the specimen volume can be measured and finite detection efficiency means that
not all atoms in the measured volume will be detected. Neutral atoms can escape detection. Some ions
escape detection because they hit into walls of the analysis_chamber.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Raw data are typically processed as follows:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Detector pulses and their timing are processed and discriminated into signal events of different quality levels.
High quality events might be considered in further processing to identify the corresponding molecular ion
and its original position in the reconstructed volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal calibration and filtering steps are applied to convert raw time-of-flight data to calibrated
mass-to-charge state ratio values and obtain calibrated impact positions on the detector.</p></li>
<li><p>Ranging and identifying an ion that corresponds to each detector event.
Isotopic abundance and theoretical models inform these ranging algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, such selected ion impact positions and iontypes are used to compute a reconstructed volume of
the specimen using backprojection algorithms. In effect, an atom probe measurement is a combination of
a data acquisition and a data analysis workflow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not only in AMETEK/Cameca’s APSuite/IVAS software, which the majority of atom probers use, these concepts
are well distinguished. However, the algorithms used to transform correlations between pulses and physical
events into actual events, the so-called detector hits of ions, is a proprietary one. This algorithm is also
referred to as the hit finding algorithm.</p>
<p>Due to this practical inaccessibility of details, virtually all atom probe studies currently use a reporting
schema where the course of the specimen evaporation is documented such that quantities are a function of
evaporation_id i.e. actual event/ion, i.e. after having the hit finding algorithm and correlations applied.
That is the evaporation_id values take the role of an implicit time and course of the experiment given that
ion extraction physically is a sequential process.</p>
<p>This application definition includes fields that the atom probe community has decided to represent best practices
for reporting atom probe measurements. Exemplar mapping tables are provided for documents that reported these
best practices to translate technical term into concepts of the NXapm application definition.</p>
<p><em>The NeXus application definition NXapm defines a hierarchical data model with ten building blocks:</em></p>
<p>The data model represents a tree of concepts. The tree is constructed from groups of concepts representing
the branches, together with fields and attributes representing leaves. NXapm is defined by composing and
specializing base classes into the following ten categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">definition</span></code> specifies that the data schema is NXapm. In combination with
administrative metadata such as the attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NeXus_version</span></code> provided by <a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXroot.html#nxroot"><span class="std std-ref">NXroot</span></a> this
specifies which version of NXapm the instance data in a NeXus/HDF5 file are compliant with.</p></li>
<li><p>The fields <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run_number</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">experiment_alias</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">experiment_description</span></code> and
the group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">userID</span></code> provide concepts for storing organizational metadata that
contextualize the work within the research workflow and humans involved in this.</p></li>
<li><p>The fields <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start_time</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">end_time</span></code> provide concepts for framing a temporal context for the research.</p></li>
<li><p>The groups <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">citeID</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noteID</span></code> provide concepts for adding contextual details such as citations or notes
that are associated with the data, i.e. other artifacts that are deemed relevant when reporting about
a measurement or simulation. These groups are useful when NXapm is used as a serialization format for
technology-partner-agnostic archival of data and metadata that have been collected during a session with
an atom probe instrument. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms that refer to an
uninterrupted period of measurement. Resuming measurement on a specimen after an interruption is viewed
as a new run and the new data should not be appended to the previous run, but written to either a new NXentry,
or a new file. Removing the specimen from the instrument is an interruption. Changing evaporation conditions
while the specimen is remains in the analysis_chamber and resuming thereafter the measurement
is not considered as an interruption. It is a common strategy to probe the evaporation process for different
instrument parameters. Each individual collection should then though be stored in an own NXapm_event_data
group. Parking the specimen to the buffer_chamber and resuming the measurement at a later stage is an interruption.
During a run, the microscope is used for a certain amount of time to characterize a single specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>The groups <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sample</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">specimen</span></code> provide concepts for storing metadata about the sample and the specimen,
i.e. the smaller part that was removed from the sample to be measured in the atom probe session.
The term “tip” in the context of atom probe research is considered jargon.
Specimen is an exact synonym for tip.</p></li>
<li><p>The field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">operation_mode</span></code> and group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code> provides concepts that
are useful for describing a measurement during a session with an atom probe or field-ion microscope.
This includes the chain of events of data and metadata that were collected during such a session.</p></li>
<li><p>The group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simulation</span></code> provides concepts that are useful for describing a simulation of an
atom extraction, ionization, and ion trajectory simulation. Combined with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code>
this provides a data schema for defining a digital twin of the instrument and its setup.</p></li>
<li><p>The groups <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">consistent_rotations</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NAMED_reference_frame</span></code> provide concepts for
reporting coordinate systems (frames of reference) and rotation conventions that clarify how data
should be interpreted specifying the rotation of orientable objects in the microscope, its components,
or of crystals and crystal defects in the material analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>The group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID</span></code> provides concepts for the computational workflows that were
used to convert raw detector data into reconstructed ion positions and documentation of
ranging definitions made.</p></li>
<li><p>The group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">profiling</span></code> provides concepts for reporting computational details such as
programs and libraries used, for documenting the libraries of virtual environments such as those used
by conda or python virtual environment, including details about the computing hardware used, and
documenting capabilities for performance analyses and benchmarking of the software or its parts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Design choices:</em></p>
<p>Given that most atom probe instruments across the globe were built by AMETEK/Cameca and are delivered
with the AP Suite/IVAS software there is some homogeneity in how a measurement is performed and which data
artifacts and algorithms used for data processing. Complementary use of open-source software specifically for
the reconstruction, ranging, and later data processing stages contributes to a landscape of multiple tools in use.
Therefore, communication of atom probe research differs between user groups. This holds even more so true
for the sub community in atom probe which study physical mechanisms involved during ionization to the point that
here that almost each research work defines different simulation tools with different types of data artifacts.</p>
<p>NXapm defines constraints on the existence and cardinality of concepts and its concept branches but seeks to
offer a compromise. The key design pattern followed is that most branches are made optional or at most recommended
but their child concepts are conditionally required. Thereby, NXapm can cover a variety of simple but also complex
use cases. An example of this parent-optional-but-children-stronger-restricted design is the combination of the
optional group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code> with its required child <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/instrument</span></code>:
Users which report simulations are not forced to document the instrument but users which have characterized
a specimen are motivated to report about the instrument. They are though not  necessarily required to report all
the details of the instruments’ components because the design pattern is applied recursively.</p>
<p><em>NXapm distinguishes and stores instance data based on how long they remain unchanged:</em></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code> provides two groups <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/instrument</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/eventID</span></code>.
The first group is designed for storing metadata about the instrument that do not change over the course of the session.
Examples are the name of the technology partner who built the microscope or whether a laser or voltage pulser
and reflectron exists or not. The second group is designed for metadata and data that are collected during
the session with the instrument. These, are stored as instances of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/eventID</span></code>,
events that can be time-stamped individually.
Each instance of a group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/eventID</span></code> contains <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement/instrument</span></code> whose purpose is to
store those specific state and settings of the instrument that was present during the collection of the event.
Thereby, changing conditions such as campaigns with different target detection rate can be stored.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, such an approach of the atom probe detecting groups of events and storing these as groups has also
been in use in the proprietary software via CamecaRoot, a set of customized data structures and file formats that use
the CernRoot library. By virtue of design this reduces unnecessary repetition of metadata stored in the first group.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID</span></code> offer classes for the each task relevant task in the data processing pipeline that converts raw detector
event data to calibrated mass-to-charge-state-ratio values and hit_position on the detector. These include
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">initial_specimen</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">final_specimen</span></code> locations for storing images of the specimen prior/after the measurement as
considered best practice by AMETEK/Cameca, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">raw_data</span></code> for delay-line timing data, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hit_finding</span></code> for details of the
hit finding algorithm, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hit_spatial_filtering</span></code> a process that filters hits of too low quality and those laying outside the about
to be computed reconstruction volume. Furthermore, group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">voltage_and_bowl</span></code> offers a place for documenting calibrations
and processing nonlinearities. Group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mass_to_charge_conversion</span></code> is used to document the mass calibration and the
conversion from time-of-flight to mass-to-charge-state-ratio values.</p>
<p>Finally, the groups <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reconstruction</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ranging</span></code> were designed to match and document the classical approaches how
from all the previous sources of input one can compute a reconstructed volume, and apply peak fitting routines on the
mass-to-charge-state-ratio histogram to label ions, i.e. range them for their isotopic identity.
Group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID/reconstruction/naive_discretization</span></code> offers a standardized way to report simple
three-dimensional histograms. Group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID</span></code> and its
complementing group <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID/charge_state_analysis</span></code>
solves the issue that the ranging definitions in classical file formats are not reported for always for their isotopic identity
and charge state. The field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/iontypes</span></code> provides a place for
storing a compact representation of the results of each ranging definition made at the level of each ion.</p>
<p><em>The compatibility of NXapm and NXem:*</em></p>
<p>The design of NXapm mirrors that of <a class="reference internal" href="NXem.html#nxem"><span class="std std-ref">NXem</span></a>. This was an intentional choice to support the increasingly stronger connection between
these two materials characterization methods, especially in light of recent advances in the direct coupling of atom probe and
transmission electron microscopes and scanning transmission electron microscopes.</p>

<summary>The identifier whereby the experiment is referred to in the control software ...</summary><p>The identifier whereby the experiment is referred to in the control software.</p>
<p>It is common practice in atom probe research to refer to a measurement on a single
specimen as a run. When working with AMETEK/Cameca instruments it is a common
practice also to store all data associated with such a run in files whose name
is composed from a prefix that details the type of instrument (e.g. R5076) followed
by the run_number. These filenames are often used as the specimen_name or
experiment_identifier. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms.</p>
<p>For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen,
or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the identifier which matches
best conceptually to the LEAP run number.</p>
<p>The field does not have to be required, if the information is recoverable
in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case; provided these
RHIT or HITS files respectively are stored alongside a data artifact.
With NXapm the RHIT or HITS can be stored via NXnote in the
hit_finding algorithm section.</p>
<p>As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run

<p>The start_time is required in order to ensure that at least one point in time
is provided for full temporal context to a measurement and simulation
when writing instance data using NXapm. Otherwise, the instance data
can not be sorted in order or even placed in a logical sequence to other
steps of the research workflow, which would disallow using functionalities
in research data management systems that rely on temporal context.</p>
<p>Specifying start_time and end_time is useful for capturing more detailed
bookkeeping of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with
having both dates specified, it may not be possible to infer how long
the experiment took or for how long data were collected.</p>
<p>More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be

has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.

<p>To achieve unique names, the prefix “NAMED” should be replaced to
with something derived from an alias for the coordinate system,
or the value of the “alias” field.</p>
<p>Use the suffix _reference_frame when creating specific instances
of NXcoordinate_system e.g. laboratory_reference_frame,
reconstruction_reference_frame and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
stack. This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
within a predefined evaporation identifier interval. Typically, the set of
ion evaporation sequence identifiers is grouped into chunks.</p>
<p>For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.</p>

and dependencies of the software. In the case of AP Suite/IVAS this can be used
to document the AP Suite GUI, LAS, CamecaRoot, and CernRoot versions.
In this case always name the program groups program1, program2, …
with program one being AP Suite/IVAS.</p>
<p>In the case of an open-source instrument, like P. Felfer’s Oxcart or G. Schmitz’s
M-TAP instruments, also use program1, program2, … with program1 representing
the control software e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://pyccapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">M. Monajem and P. Felfer PYCCAPT</a>.
Further instances (program2, …) can be used to list the dependencies, the
python virtual environment.</p>
