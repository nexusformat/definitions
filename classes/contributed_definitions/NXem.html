<summary>Characterization of a sample during a session on an electron microscope. ...</summary><p>Characterization of a sample during a session on an electron microscope.</p>
<p><strong>The idea and aim of NXem</strong>:
Electron microscopy (EM) research, whether it be performed with scanning electron
microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM) instruments, uses
versatile tools for preparing and characterizing samples and specimens.
The term specimen is considered a synonym for sample in this application definition.
A specimen is a physical portion of material that is studied/characterized during
the microscope session, eventually in different places on the specimen surface,
illuminating the surface layers or shining through thin specimens.
These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, an electron microscope is an electron accelerator.
Experimentalists use it in sessions during which they characterize as well as
prepare specimens. This application definition describes data and metadata about
processes and characterization tasks applied to one specimen.
The application definition focuses on the usage of EM in materials research.
The application definition design makes it in principle applicable also in
cryo-EM on biomaterials.</p>
<p>Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple <a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXentry.html#nxentry"><span class="std std-ref">NXentry</span></a> instances.</p>
<p><strong>Electron microscopes motivate the development of a comprehensive data schema:</strong>
There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of scientists.
These users may perform analyses for other users as a service task, especially
in large research facility settings. Oftentimes, though, and especially for
cutting-edge instruments, the scientists guide the process and maybe even control
the microscope. Instruments are usually controlled on-premises but also more
and more functionalities for remote control have become available.
Scientists oftentimes can ask technicians for support. In all cases,
these people are considered users. Users might have different
roles though.</p>
<p>The rational behind a common EM schema rather than making separate schemas
for SEM or TEM are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM
instruments:</p>
<p>Both type of instruments have electro-magnetic lenses. These may differ in
design, alignment, number, and level of corrected for aberrations.
As an obvious difference, a TEM is mainly used for measuring the transmitted
electron beam. This calls for using a different lens setup and relative
placement of the specimen in the lens setup. Also TEM specimens are
substantially thinner than specimens characterized with SEM to enable an
illumination through the specimen. This offers capabilities for probing of
additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction which are
unavailable in SEMs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
measure different types of signals that originate from the same set of
radiation/specimen interactions. Often these detectors have a similar design
and technology or are even used both in SEMs and TEMs.</p>
<p><strong>A comprehensive schema instead of specific SEM or TEM schemas</strong>:
Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower it
is the addressed circle of users which develops or uses schemas for research
data management (RDM) with EM, the more understandable it is that scientists
of either community (or sub-community) ask for designing method-specific schemas.</p>
<p>Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
(X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
schemas such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.</p>
<p>However, the history of electron microscopy has shown that these activities led
to a zoo of schemas and vocabulary, with implementation in many data and file formats,
difficult to make interoperable. Instead of trying to maintain this, we would like
to advocate that the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">FAIR principles</a>
should guide all decisions how data and metadata should be stored.</p>
<p>EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different schemas
with associated representations of data and metadata: Each combination of
schemas or an interoperable-made handshake between two file formats or software
packages has to be maintained by software developers. This counts especially
when data should be processed interoperably between software packages.</p>
<p>This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
between tools have to be maintained. This can result in usage of different
terminology, which in turn results in representations and connections made
between different data representations and workflows that are not
machine-actionable.
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary">There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology.</a></p>
<p><strong>The advantage of working towards a common vocabulary and representation</strong>:
A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemas and
scientists can reuse for instance these terms, thus supporting interoperability.
Ideally, scientists specialize an application definition only for the few very
specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemas.</p>
<p>Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemas rather than
a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
academia and industry as it enables a focusing of software development
efforts on those schemas, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonizing
their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
for technology partners building EM hard- and software as it improves the
longevity of certain schemas; and thus can help with incentivizing them to support
the community with implementing support for such schemas into their applications.</p>
<p>In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.</p>
<p>The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
(EM-research specific base classes) for defining schemas for EM research.
Thereby, NXem can be useful to extends top-level ontologies towards a domain-
and method-specific ontology for electron microscopy as it is used for
materials research.</p>
<p>Working towards a common vocabulary is a community activity that profits from
everybody reflecting in detail whether certain terms they have used in the past
are not eventually conceptually similar if not the same as what this application
definition and its base classes provide. We are happy for receiving your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the generality versus specificity challenge</strong>:
It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for NeXus), schemas differ
already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
but it is set optional in another schema. If group(s), field(s), or
attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemas can
become inconsistent. It is noteworthy to mention that the idea of a NeXus application
definition serves as a contract between a data provider and a data consumer.
Providers can be the software of a specific microscopes or users with specific
analysis needs. Consumers can be again specific software tools, like vendor
software for controlling the instrument or a scientific software for doing
artificial intelligence analyses on EM data). Such changes of a schema lead
to new versions.</p>
<p><strong>Verification of constraints and conditions</strong>:
Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against all such possible inconsistencies;
however NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which schemas can be
documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
(at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable
and interoperable FAIR data.</p>
<p>This stresses again the fundamental and necessary role of working towards
a common vocabulary and, with a longer perspective in mind, a machine-actionable
knowledge representation and verification engine. So far many conditions and
requirements are formulated in the docstrings of the respective entries of
the application definition.</p>
<p><strong>NXem takes a key step towards standardization of EM data schemas</strong>.
It offers a controlled vocabulary and set of relations between concepts and
enables the description of the data which are collected for research with
electron microscopes. To be most efficient and offering reusability, the NXem
application definition should be understood as a template that one should
ideally use as is. NXem can be considered a base for designing more specialized
definitions. These should ideally be prefixed with NXem_method (e.g. NXem_ebsd).</p>
<p><strong>The use of NXem should be as follows:</strong>
Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but leave these
optional or, even better, propose changes to NXem.</p>
<p>A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
It is questionable to which level such a reproducibility is possible with EM
at all considering beam damage, effects of the environment, and other not
exactly quantifiable influences.
While this points to the physical limitations there are also practical and
economical constraints on how completely EM research can be documented:
For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
may not be retrievable as technology partners have a substantiated interest in
finding a compromise between being open to their users and securing their
business models.</p>
<p>By design, EM experiments illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
procedures and system setups should be addressed first.</p>
<p>If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
between clarity but being system-agnostic at the same time.
Settings of apertures are an example where aperture modes are in most cases
aliases behind which there is a set of very detailed settings specific to the
software and control units used. These settings are difficult to retrieve,
are not fully documented by technology partners. This simplification for
users of microscopes makes experiments easier understandable.
On the flipside these subtilities limit the opportunities of especially open-
source developments to make data schemas covering enough for general usage and
specific enough and sufficiently detailed to remain useful for
research by electron microscopy domain experts.</p>
<p>Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting
this NXem application definition and base classes is that there are numerous
(technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
place to hold these nested representations; however as discussed
at the cost of generality.</p>
<p>Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
it especially challenging is when the application definition is expected to
hold all data that might be of relevance for future questions.</p>
<p>We are skeptical if there is one such representation that can fulfill all these
aims and interest, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable
by a large number of scientists in a community. However, we are also convinced
that this is not a reason to accept the status quo of having a very large set
of oftentimes strongly overlapping and redundant schemas.</p>
<p>NXem is our proposal to motivate the EM community to work towards more
standardization and discussion of what constitutes data, i.e. metadata,
numerical and categorical data in research with electron microscopes. We found
that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled vocabulary.</p>
<p>We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.
Therefore,</p>
<p><strong>This application definition has the following components at the top-level:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should
have an associated time-zone-aware time stamp and report of the specific
settings of the microscope at that point in time when the image was taken.
This is why instances of <a class="reference internal" href="NXevent_data_em.html#nxevent-data-em"><span class="std std-ref">NXevent_data_em</span></a> have their own em_lab section.
The reason is that EMs can be highly dynamic, used to illuminate the specimen
differently or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.
What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement?
This can be the collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),
taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set of
EBSD line scans and/or surface mappings in an SEM, or the ion-beam-milling of a
specimen in preparation for e.g. an atom probe experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXmonitor.html#nxmonitor"><span class="std std-ref">NXmonitor</span></a>;
instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities
pertaining to specific components of the instrument.
Alternatively, NXevent_data_em instances can be used to store
time-zone-aware dates of the components, which is
relevant for documenting as exactly as practically possible settings
when images and spectra were taken.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXinstrument.html#nxinstrument"><span class="std std-ref">NXinstrument</span></a>;
conceptually this is a container to store an arbitrary level of detail of the
technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which
the microscope is operated.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXuser.html#nxuser"><span class="std std-ref">NXuser</span></a>;
conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details
who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be
referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store
individualized details of who executed an event of data acquisition or processing.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="NXevent_data_em.html#nxevent-data-em"><span class="std std-ref">NXevent_data_em</span></a> instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;
each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details
about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and
relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXdata.html#nxdata"><span class="std std-ref">NXdata</span></a>; at the top-level, this is a place for documenting available
default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for research data
management systems to show a visual representation of some
aspect of the content of the EM session.
Default plottables are not intended to serve every possible analysis and
visualization demand but are instead a preview. We made this choice
because what constitutes a useful default plot is often a matter of interpretation,
somewhat of personal taste, and community standards. In effect, default
plottables are case- and method-specific.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals.
Examples for possible default plottables could be arbitrarily taken secondary,
back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern, EELS spectra, composition,
or orientation mappings to name but a few.</p>
<p><strong>There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Images and spectra should be stored as <a class="reference internal" href="NXimage_set.html#nximage-set"><span class="std std-ref">NXimage_set</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="NXspectrum_set.html#nxspectrum-set"><span class="std std-ref">NXspectrum_set</span></a>
instances to hold data at the earliest possible step in the computational
processing (which is usually performed with the microscope control and or
integrated analysis software). The formatting of the NXdata groups enables the
display of image and spectra with web technology visualization software.</p></li>
<li><p>When two- and three-dimensional geometric primitive data are stored, it is useful
to write additional optional <a class="reference external" href="https://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format">XDMF</a>
fields which support additional plotting of the data with visualization software.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of
data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible
electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Images based on electron counts are typically detected with specific operation modes
such as bright field or dark field imaging in TEM or secondary/back-scattered electron
imaging in SEM.</p></li>
<li><p>Also spectra (X-ray quanta or Auger electron counts) typically are referred to
under the assumption of a specific operation mode of the microscope.</p></li>
<li><p>These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical processing.
These data and processing steps are modelled as instances of <a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXprocess.html#nxprocess"><span class="std std-ref">NXprocess</span></a>
which use terms from a controlled vocabulary e.g. SE (secondary electron),
BSE (back-scattered electron), Kikuchi, X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
should be stored (in memory or on disk)</strong>.</p>
<p>The application definition NXem is a graph which describes how numerical data
and (meta)data for EM research are related to one another.</p>
<p>Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
at the microscope.
Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.</p>
<p>It is possible that different types of programs might be used to
perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is
the case the processing should be structured with individual <a class="reference internal" href="../base_classes/NXprocess.html#nxprocess"><span class="std std-ref">NXprocess</span></a>
instances. If the program and/or version used for processing referred
to in an NXprocess group is different to the program and version
mentioned in this field, the NXprocess needs
to hold an own program and version.</p>

group again the details of the gun type and manufacturer but only the
high-voltage if for that event the high-voltage was different. If for all
events the high-voltage was the same it is not even necessary to include
an electron_source section in the event.</p>

<p>An event is a time interval during which the microscope was configured
in a specific way. The microscope is considered as stable enough during
this interval that a measurement with one or multiple detectors is
possible. What constitutes such time interval depends on how the
microscope is used and which measurements the user would like to perform.</p>
<p>Each NXevent_data_em instance holds one acquisition task with detectors.
Each NXevent_data_em section contains an em_lab group in which specific
settings and states of the microscope during the time interval
can be stored to document the history of states of the microscope over
the course of the session.</p>
<p>The NXem application definition offers maximal flexibility.
One extreme could be that the only one NXevent_data_em instance is used
and this covers the time interval of the entire session at the microscope.
The other extreme case is that each collection of an image or even
single spot measurement is defined as an NXevent_data_em instance.
In this case the em_lab group inside the NXevent_data_em also holds
the specific time-dependent state of the microscope with which in theory
all dynamics of the system (if measured) can be captured and documented.</p>
<p>Nowadays microscopes exists for which hard- and software solutions
enable a tracking of the dynamics of the microscope and the actions
of the user (such as with solution like AXONSynchronicity from Protochips).
The NXem application definition can however also be used for less
complex interaction and lower demands wrt to time tracking activities.</p>
<p>An NXevent_data_em instance holds specific details about how raw data from
a detector were processed. Raw data may already be post-processed as
they are accessible only by the control software with after some internal
processing happened. Nevertheless, these data have to be distinguished from
post-processed data where e.g. raw data are converted to interpreted
spectra, or orientation mappings.</p>
<p>This post-processing tasks can be performed (on-the-fly, i.e. during
acquisition for sure during the microscope session) or afterwards.
Post-processing is performed with commercial software or various
types and scripts.</p>
<p>Currently, several specializations of NXimage_set and Nspectrum_set
are used which store some details of this processing. However, as post-
processing tasks can be substantially more advanced and involved it
is clear that data artifacts from the measurement and data artifacts
generated during post-processing are weakly connected only, maybe
exclusively by the fact that a complex numerical post-processing workflow
just takes one raw dataset from an NXevent_data_em instance but generates
multiple derived data artifacts from this. All these should be described
as own application definitions and only weak connections should be made
to an instance of NXem. Instances of NXsubentry is one mechanism in
NeXus how this can be achieved in the future.</p>

<summary>A container holding a specific result of the measurement and ...</summary><p>A container holding a specific result of the measurement and

<p>NXevent_data_em instances can hold several specific NXimage_em or
NXspectrum_em instances taken and considered as one event, i.e.
a point in time when the microscope had the settings specified
either in NXinstrument or in this NXevent_data_em instance.</p>
<p>The application definition is designed without an explicit need for
having an NXevent_data_em instance that contains an NXimage_em or
NXspectra_em instance. Thereby, an NXevent_data_em can also be used
for just documentation about the specific state of the microscope
irrespective whether data have been collected during this time interval.</p>
<p>In other words the NXinstrument group details primarily the more
static settings and components of the microscope as they are found
by the operator during the session. The NXevent_data_em samples
the dynamics.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to store data in NXebeam, NXibeam instances
of NXevent_data_em but in this case it is assumed that the settings
were constant over the entire course of the microscope session
and thus all relevant metadata inside the NXinstrument groups
are sufficient to understand the session.</p>
<p>So far there exists no standard which a majority of the technology
partners and the materials science electron microscopy community
have accepted which could be used for a very generic documentation,
storage and exchange of electron microscope data. Therefore, it is
still a frequent case that specific files have many fields which cannot
safely be mapped or interpreted.
<strong>Therefore, users are always given the advice to keep the vendor files.</strong>
Working however with these vendor files inside specific software,
like materials databases, demands for parsers which extract pieces of
information from the vendor representation (numerical data and metadata)
and map them on a schema with which the database and its associated
software tools can work with.</p>
<p>Currently, one would loose immediately track of e.g. provenance and
the origin of certain data in NXevent_data_em instances unless really
all data are safely and reliably copied over into an instance of the
schema. Currently, though, this is sadly effectively prevented in many
cases as vendors indeed implemented often sophisticated provenance
and commercial software state tracking tools but these are not yet
documented covering enough in our opinion so that it is safe to assume
all vendor field names are known, logically understood, interpretable,
and thus mappable on a common schema using a controlled common
vocabulary.</p>
<p>Therefore we encourage user for now to store for each NXimage_set
or NXspectra_set instance to supply the so-called source of the data.
This can for instance be the name and hashvalue of the original
file which was acquired during the microscope session and from which then
certain details like numerical data and metadata were copied into an
instance of this schema for the purpose of working with the data in
e.g. tools offered by research data management (RDM) systems or
materials database.</p>
<p>During our work on implementing file format/metadata parsers and
developing this application definition, we realized that <strong>several
software tools currently do not consistently format critical metadata
like time-zone-aware timestamps</strong> when events of data collection or
processing happened.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage the community and especially the vendors
to work towards a standardization, or at least an open documentation
of the way how time-zone-aware time data are collected and stored how
and where during a microscope session and how they end up in files
and databases with which users interact.
This would enable to supplement instances of this schema with specific
time data and assure that these time data can be used to reliably
contextualize individual datasets and processing steps in materials
information systems.</p>
<p>For the reason that these measures have not yet been fully taken,
the start_time and end_time is a recommended option.
The idea behind these time-zone-aware dates is to identify when
the data were collected at the microscope but NOT when they were
transcoded by some software tool(s) while storing the data in an
instance of this schema.</p>
