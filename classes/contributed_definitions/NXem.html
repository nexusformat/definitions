<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Characterization and session with one sample in an electron microscope.</p>
<p><strong>The idea and aim of NXem</strong>:
Electron microscopes (EM), whether it be a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
or a transmission electron microscope (TEM), are versatile tools for preparing
and characterizing samples and specimens. The term specimen is here understood
as a synonym for a sample. A specimen is a physical portion of material that
is studied/characterize in the microscope session, eventually in different
places on the specimen surface.
These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, an EM is an electron accelerator. Experimentalists use an EM
in sessions during which they characterize as well as prepare specimens.
This application definition describes data and metadata about processes and
characterization tasks applied to one specimen.</p>
<p>Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple NXentry instances.</p>
<p>There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of
(staff) scientists. These users perform analyses for other users as a service
task. Oftentimes, though, and especially for cutting-edge instruments,
the scientists and their team guide the process while operating the
microscope. Oftentimes the scientists operate the instrument themselves
either on-site or remotely and can ask technicians for support.
In all cases, these people are considered users. Users might have different
roles though.</p>
<p>The rational behind a common EM schema rather than separate SEM or TEM
schemata are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM instruments:
Both have electro-magnetic lenses. These lens may differ in design, alignment,
number, and level of corrected-for aberrations. As an obvious difference,
a TEM is used mainly to measure the transmitted electron beam.
This demands thinner specimens as in SEM but offers capabilities for probing
of additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction.</p>
<p>Compared to SEMs, TEMs have a different relative arrangement between the
lenses and the specimen which is most obvious by the different relative
arrangement of the objective lens versus the specimen.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
measure different types of signals that originate though from the same set of
radiation/specimen interactions. Consequently, detectors can also be similar.</p>
<p>Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower
the addressed user base is which develops or uses schemata for
research data management with EM, the more understandable it is
that scientists of either community (or sub-community) ask for
method-specific schemata.</p>
<p>Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
(X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
schemata such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.</p>
<p>The development in the past has shown that these activities led to a zoo of
schemata and implementations of these into many data and file formats.
There is nothing which prevents the communities to make these schemata
open and interoperable. Open here means specifically not that all data are
compliant with/or use the schema and have to end up in the open-source domain.
There can be embargo periods first of all. Open means that the metadata and
associated schemata are documented in a manner that as many details as
possible are open in the sense that others can understand what the
(meta)data mean conceptually.
The <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">FAIR principles</a> guide all
decisions how data and metadata should be stored.</p>
<p>EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different
schemata with associated representations of data and metadata in EM:
Each combination of schemata or an interoperable-made handshake between two
file formats or software packages has to be maintained by software developers.
This counts especially when data should be processed interoperably
between software packages.</p>
<p>This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
between tools to maintain. This can result in usage of different terminology.
Which in turn results in representations and connections made between
different data representations and workflows that are not machine-actionable.
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary">There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology.</a></p>
<p>A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemata
and scientists can take for instance then these terms as closely as possible.
Ideally, they specialize the application definition only for the few very
specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemata.</p>
<p>Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemata rather than
a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
academia as it enables the EM community to focus their software development
efforts on those schemata, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonize
their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
for vendors of EM hard- and software as it improves the longevity of certain
schema and thus can help to incentivize vendors to support the community with
implementing support for such schemata into their proprietary applications.</p>
<p>In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.</p>
<p>The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
(EM-research specific base classes) for using NeXus to define schemata for
electron microscopy research. Working towards a common vocabulary is a
community activity that profits from everybody reflecting in detail whether
certain terms they have used are not eventually conceptually similar if not
the same as what this application definition and its base classes provide.</p>
<p>We are happy for receiving your feedback.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for) NeXus, schema differ
already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
but it is set optional in another version. If group(s), field(s), or
attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemata can
become inconsistent. An application definition here serves as a contract
between a data provider and a data consumer. These two can be software tools
(like the vendor software to drive the instrument or a scientific software
for doing artificial intelligence with EM data).
Such changes of a schema lead to new versions.</p>
<p>Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against inconsistencies; however
NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which schemata can be
documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
(at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable
and interoperable FAIR data.
A common vocabulary and a machine-actionable knowledge representation/engine
is also required. Essentially when the docstrings are no longer needed
but can be replaced by a connection to an automated tool which understands
what a specific field represents conceptually, EM data have become more
generally interoperable EM data.</p>
<p>This application definition takes a key step into this direction.
It offers a controlled vocabulary and relation between concepts and data
relevant for research with electron microscopes. To be most efficient and
offering reusability, the application definition should be understood as a
template that one should ideally use as is. This application definition
is called NXem. It can be considered a base for more specialized definitions
(ideally prefixed with NXem) <em>method</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The use of NXem should be as follows:</strong>
Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but make
them optional or, even better, propose changes in the application definition.</p>
<p>A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
may not be retrievable.</p>
<p>EM experiments by design illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
procedures and system setups should be addressed first.</p>
<p>If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
between clarity and being vendor-agnostic. Settings of apertures are an
example where aperture modes are aliases behind which there is a set of
settings. These settings are difficult to retrieve, often undocumented in
detail. This serves users and makes EM experiments easier understandable and
conveniently executable for a broader user base. The opportunities for
application definitions to offer an abstraction layer are limited.</p>
<p>Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting
the application definition and base classes is that there are numerous
(technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
place to hold these nested representations; however at the cost of generality.</p>
<p>Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
it especially challenging if the application definition is expected to hold
all data that might be of relevance for future questions.</p>
<p>We are skeptical if there is one representation that can fulfill all these
aims, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable by a large
number of scientists in a community. With this application definition we
would like to motivate the community to work towards such aim. While doing
so we found that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled
vocabulary.</p>
<p>We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.</p>
<p><strong>This application definition has the following components at the top-level:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generic experimental details (timestamp, identifiers, name);
conceptually these are session details. A session at a microscope may
involve the characterization of multiple specimens. For each specimen
an instance of an (NXentry) is created. Details of the instrument have to
be stored at least in an entry. Other entries should refer to these
metadata via links to reduce redundancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should
have an associated time stamp and report of the specific settings at that
point in time when the image was taken. The reason is that EMs can be
highly dynamic, be used to illuminate the specimen differently
or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.
What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement? This can be the
collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),
taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set
of EBSD line scan and surface mappings in an SEM, or ion-beam-milling of a
specimen in preparation for an atom probe experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>NXmonitor;
instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities
pertaining to specific components of the instrument. Alternatively
NXevent_data_em instances can be used to store timestamp states of the
components, which is relevant to document the exact settings when images
and spectra were taken.</p></li>
<li><p>NXinstrument;
conceptually this is a container to store arbitrary level of detail of the
technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which
it is operated.</p></li>
<li><p>NXuser;
conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details
who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be
referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store
individualized details who executed an event.</p></li>
<li><p>NXevent_data_em instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;
each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details
about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and
relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).</p></li>
<li><p>NXdata; a the top-level, conceptually, this is a place for documenting
available default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for
research data management systems to show a visual representation of some
aspect of the content of the EM session.
It is clear that what constitutes a useful default plot is a matter of
interpretation, somewhat of personal taste, and community standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In effect, default plottables are case- and method-specific.
Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals and
images. Examples for possible default plottables could be an arbitrarily
taken: secondary, back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern,
EELS spectra, composition, or orientation mappings to name but a few.</p>
<p><strong>There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Above images, spectra, and mappings should be stored as NXdata instances,
ideally formatted in such a way that they can be displayed with
visualization software that can be specific for the file format in which
the data are stored. NeXus specifies only the data model, i.e. the terms
and their relations. These descriptions can be implemented and stored in
JSON, HDF5, XML, or HSDS, file storage, or even other formats, although
HDF5 is the most commonly used.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of
data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible
electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Images of electron counts detected in specific operation modes (bright
field, dark field in TEM, secondary/back-scattered, Kikuchi in SEM)</p></li>
<li><p>Spectra (X-ray quanta or auger electron counts)</p></li>
<li><p>These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical
processing. It makes sense to name them with a controlled vocabulary,
e.g. SE (secondary electron), BSE (back-scattered electron), Kikuchi,
X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence) etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
should be stored (in memory or on disk). To this end the schema, here makes no
specific assumptions, not even that all the fields/group of a schema instance
have to be stored into a single file. Instead, the schema specifies the
relations between metadata, constraints on how they should be formatted, what
they conceptually represent and which terms (controlled vocabulary) is
practical to store with the data.</p>
<p>In effect, the application definition is a graph which describes how
(meta)data are related to one another.</p>

<div><p>Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used to

<p>Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
at the microscope.
Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.</p>
<p>It is possible that different types of programs might be used to
perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is
the case the processing should be structured with individual NXprocess
instances. If the program and/or version used for processing referred
to in an NXprocess group is different to the program and version

<p>An NXevent_em_data instance holds specific details about how raw data
