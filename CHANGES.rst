  This file describes user-visible changes between the versions.

  This human-composed file has been useful in other projects
  useful to point out specific issues and pull requests that
  contribute to a release. It can be composed as issues/PRs
  are resolved and then cited from the release page documentation.

  Highlights from the Change History, especially new releases,
  should be added to manual/source/history.rst.
