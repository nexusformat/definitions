  This file describes user-visible changes between the versions.
  
  This human-composed file has been useful in other projects 
  useful to point out specific issues and pull requests that 
  contribute to a release. It can be composed as issues/PRs 
  are resolved and then cited from the release page documentation.

  Highlights from the Change History, especially new releases, 
  should be added to manual/source/history.rst.
