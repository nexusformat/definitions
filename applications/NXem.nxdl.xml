        Application definition for normalized representation of electron microscopy research.
        
        This application definition is a comprehensive example for a general description
        with which to normalize specific (meta)data collected from the research field
        of electron microscopy
        
        NXem is designed to be used for documenting experiments or computer simulations in which
        controlled electron beams are used for studying electron-beam matter interaction to explore
        physical mechanisms and phenomena or to characterize materials with an electron microscope.

    <!--docstrings should be organize as such a list of blocks:
-| req: first part, concept definition, human-readable but such that one could take as is to define an concept in OWL
-| opt: second part, comment, i.e. information that in an ideal world would be ideal if represented strongly semantic
but for practical purposes currently is interpretable only by human to provide them further contextualization
-| recommended: xref part ideally also as a list of triple (spec, term, url to uri)-->

                    A collection of all programs and libraries that are considered as relevant
                    to understand with which software tools this NeXus file instance was
                    generated. Ideally, to enable a binary recreation from the input data.
                    
                    Examples include the name and version of the libraries used to write the
                    instance. Ideally, the software which writes these NXprogram instances
                    also includes the version of the set of NeXus classes i.e. the specific set
                    of base classes, application definitions, and contributed definitions
                    with which the here described concepts can be resolved.
                    
                    For the `pynxtools library &lt;https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools&gt;`_
                    which is used by the `NOMAD &lt;https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab&gt;`_
                    research data management system, it makes sense to store e.g. the GitHub
                    repository commit and respective submodule references used.
                    
                    Instances of programID can also be used to document the modules and
                    libraries that are offered by the computational environment such as those
                    parsed from conda or python virtualenv environments.

            <doc>
                Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier for referring to this experiment.
                
                An experiment should be understood in that this can be an experiment
                in reality or a computer simulation because also the latter is an experiment
                (see the Cambridge Dictionary experiment *a test done in order to find out
                something, eg if an idea is correct*).
                
                The identifier is usually issued by the facility, laboratory, or the principle investigator.
                The identifier enables to link experiments/simulations to e.g. proposals.

                Free-text description about the experiment.
                
                Users are strongly advised to parameterize the description of their experiment
                by using respective groups and fields and base classes instead of writing prose
                into the field. The reason is that such free-text field is difficult to machine-interpret.
                The motivation behind keeping this field for now is to learn in how far the
                current base classes need extension based on user feedback.

                ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
                when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
                codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
                for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
                duration is not relevant - use this start_time field.
                
                Often though it is useful to specify a time interval via setting both a start_time
                and an end_time because this enables software tools and users to collect a
                more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment.
                
                Users should be aware though that even using only start_time and end_time
                may not be sufficient to infer how long the experiment took or for how long
                data were acquired. To bookkeep more fine-grained timestamps over the
                course of the experiment is possible with start_time and end_time fields
                of respective :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.

                    Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known timestamp when
                    the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Ideally, this matches
                    the last timestamp that is mentioned in the digital resource pointed to by

                    Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially
                    required for material that is sensitive to the environment such as specimens that were
                    charged with fast diffusing elements or short-lived radioactive tracers.
                    
                    Additional time stamps prior to preparation_date should better be placed in resources
                    which describe but do not pollute the description here with prose. Resolving these
                    connected metadata is considered as within the responsibility of the
                    research data management system and not the a NeXus file.

                    The information is recorded to qualify if the beam used was likely

                    in many cases the specimen is typically thicker than what is
                    illuminatable by the electron beam.
                    
                    In this case the value should be set to the actual thickness of the specimen
                    viewed for an illumination situation where the nominal surface normal of the

                    Description of the volume of interaction between of particle-matter interaction.
                    
                    Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
                    interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
                    the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
                    or single-particle-resolved sets of trajectories.
                    
                    Explicit or implicit descriptions of the geometry of this
                    interaction volume are possible:
                    
                    * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
                      represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
                    * An explicit description is via iso-contour surface using either
                      a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
                      iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
                      Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle flux through
                      an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface) or energy-levels
                      (e.g. the case of X-rays). Details depend on the model.
                    * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
                      be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
                    
                    Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
                    is available in the literature for example:
