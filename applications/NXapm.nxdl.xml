        Application definition for real or simulated atom probe and field-ion microscopy
        experiments.
        
        To arrive at a design of base classes and an application definition that can be used
        for both real and simulated atom probe experiments, it is worthwhile to recall and
        distinguish concepts that are related to events and (molecular) ions:
        
        * Pulsing events which are used to trigger ion extraction events.
        * Physical events and corresponding signal triggered by an ion hitting the detector.
          Some of these events are not necessarily caused by or directly correlated with an identifiable pulsing event.
        * Processed ion hits which are the result of a processing that takes the physical and pulsing events as input
          returns some of these as events of sufficient quality to qualify as (molecular) ions that are
          worthwhile to be considered further and eventually included in the reconstructed volume.
        * Calibration and signal filtering steps applied to these processed ion hits as input which results in
          actually selected (molecular) ions based on which an instance of a reconstruction is created.
        * Correlation of these ions with a statistics and theoretical model of mass-to-charge-state ratio values
          and charge states of the (molecular) ions to substantiate that some of these ions can be considered
          as rangeable ions and hence an iontype can be assigned to these via running peak finding algorithms
          and subsequent peak labeling. In the field of atom probe these peak identification methods
          are known as ranging definitions.
        
        Not only in AMETEK/Cameca's APSuite/IVAS software, which the majority of atom probers use, these concepts
        are well distinguished. However, the algorithms used to transform correlations between pulses and physical
        events into actual events (detector hits) ions is a proprietary one - the so-called hit finding algorithm.
        
        Due to this practical inaccessibility of details, virtually all atom probe studies currently use a reporting
        schema where the course of the specimen evaporation is documented such that quantities are a function of
        evaporation_id i.e. actual event/ion, i.e. after having the hit finding algorithm and correlations applied.
        That is the evaporation_id values take the role of an implicit time and course of the experiment given that
        ion extraction physically is a sequential process.
        
        This application definition includes fields that have been discussed by the atom probe community to be
        represent best practices for reporting atom probe measurements. Exemplar mapping tables are provided
        which translate the technical terms for concepts in the atom probe community and this NXapm application
        definition.

                The identifier whereby the experiment is referred to in the control software.
                
                Neither is this necessarily the specimen_name nor the experiment_identifier.
                For Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) instruments, it is recommended to use the
                run_number from the proprietary software APSuite/IVAS of AMETEK/Cameca.
                
                For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen,
                or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the identifier which matches
                best conceptually to the LEAP run number.
                
                The field does not have to be required if the information is recoverable
                in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case (provided these
                RHIT or HITS files respectively are stored alongside a data artifact).
                With NXapm the RHIT or HITS can be stored via NXnote in the
                hit_finding algorithm section.
                
                As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
                It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
                while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
                needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
                We follow this habit of most atom probe groups. Such interrupted runs
                should be stored as individual :ref:`NXentry` instances in one NeXus file.

                the measurement is not relevant, start_time only should be used.
                
                Often though it is useful to specify both start_time and end_time to
                capture more detailed bookkeeping of the experiment. The user should
                be aware that even with having both dates specified, it may not be

                were collected.
                
                More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
                collected to compute this event chain during the experiment. For this
                purpose the :ref:`NXevent_data_apm` instance should be used.

            <doc>
                A coordinate system. Multiple instances require unique names.
                
                Several Euclidean coordinate systems (CS) are used in the field of atom probe:
                
                * World space;
                  a CS specifying a local coordinate system of the planet earth which
                  identifies into which direction gravity is pointing such that
                  the laboratory space CS can be rotated into this world CS.
                * The laboratory space;
                  a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or
                  a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the
                  transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod
                  has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.
                  In summary, this CS is defined by the chassis of the instrument.
                * The specimen space;
                  a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,
                  whose z axis points towards the detector.
                * The detector space;
                  a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the
                  detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.
                  This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion
                  positions.
                * The reconstruction space;
                  a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.
                  The orientation depends on the analysis software used.
                * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the
                  flight path of individual ions might be defined.
                
                To achieve unique names, the prefix "NAMED" should be replaced to
                with something derived from an alias for the coordinate system,
                or the value of the "alias" field.
                
                Use the suffix _reference_frame when creating specific instances
                of NXcoordinate_system e.g. laboratory_reference_frame,
                reconstruction_reference_frame and so on and so forth.
                
                In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
                space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
                (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
                within a predefined evaporation identifier interval. Typically, the set of
                ion evaporation sequence identifiers is grouped into chunks.
                
                For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
                is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
                the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
                
                To avoid these ambiguities, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations` should be used.

                    From these tuples, hits are computed in a process called hit_finding.

                        The indices of this array are used in hit_quality to encode hit_quality for each
                        pulse in a more efficient way than by repeating the string that is used for each
                        type as it is provided in this field.
                        
                        As an example, assume two types, "golden" and "partial", are distinguished.
                        If hit_quality_type stores the array "golden", "partial", the index 0
                        in hit_quality identifies all those pulses of category "golden",
                        while the index 1 in hit_quality identifies all of category "partial".

                                Category for the peak offering a qualitative statement of the location of the peak
                                in light of limited mass-resolving power that is relevant for
                                composition quantification. See `D. Larson et al. (p172) &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-8721-0&gt;`_

                                * 1, close, but can be sufficiently separated for quantification in a LEAP system, :math:`^{94}Mo^{3+}`, :math:`^{63}Cu^{2+}`
                                * 2, closely overlapping, demands better than LEAP4000X MRP can provide :math:`^{14}N^{+}`, :math:`^{28}Si^{2+}` at different charge states
                                * 3, overlapped exactly due to multi-charge molecular species, :math:`^{16}{O_{2}}^{2+}`, :math:`^{16}O^{+}`
                                * 4, overlapped, same charge state, cannot as of 2013 be discriminated with a LEAP4000X, :math:`^{14}{N_{2}}^{+}`, :math:`^{28}Si^{+}`
                                * 5, overlapped, same charge state, any expectation of resolvability, :math:`^{54}Cr^{2+}`, :math:`^{54}Fe^{2+}`
