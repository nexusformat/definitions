        Application definition for real or simulated atom probe and field-ion microscopy experiments.
        
        Atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy are methods for characterizing materials
        through induced controlled extraction of individual atoms as ions and molecular ions from
        a sharp needle-shaped specimen.
        
        Offering isotopic and nanometer-scale resolution, atom probe data enable quantification of
        local chemical composition and computing of volumetric reconstructions which are models for
        the atomic architecture of the small specimen volume analyzed. These reconstructions provide
        input for characterization of atomic segregation at crystal defects. The term microstructural features
        is considered as a narrow synonym for crystal defects.
        
        The aim of the NXapm application definition is to provide a general yet specific enough
        solution to serialize artifacts for virtually all atom probe and field-ion microcopy experiments.
        
        Before summarizing the design of the base classes and the parts of the NXapm application definition,
        it is worthwhile to recall and distinguish concepts that are related to atom extraction
        events and the molecular ions that are frequently generated by the sequence of events:
        
        * An atom probe instrument uses laser or voltage pulsing events to trigger ion extraction events.
        * These ions are accelerated in an electric field towards a position-sensitive detector system.
          Physical events and corresponding signal on this detector is triggered by an ion hitting the detector.
          Some of these events are not necessarily caused by or directly correlated with an identifiable pulsing event.
        * Note that only a part the specimen volume can be measured and finite detection efficiency means that
          not all atoms in the measured volume will be detected. Neutral atoms can escape detection. Some ions
          escape detection because they hit into walls of the analysis_chamber.
         
         Raw data are typically processed as follows:
        
        * Detector pulses and their timing are processed and discriminated into signal events of different quality levels.
          High quality events might be considered in further processing to identify the corresponding molecular ion
          and its original position in the reconstructed volume.
        * Signal calibration and filtering steps are applied to convert raw time-of-flight data to calibrated
          mass-to-charge state ratio values and obtain calibrated impact positions on the detector.
        * Ranging and identifying an ion that corresponds to each detector event.
          Isotopic abundance and theoretical models inform these ranging algorithms.
        * Finally, such selected ion impact positions and iontypes are used to compute a reconstructed volume of
          the specimen using backprojection algorithms. In effect, an atom probe measurement is a combination of
          a data acquisition and a data analysis workflow.
        
        Not only in AMETEK/Cameca's APSuite/IVAS software, which the majority of atom probers use, these concepts
        are well distinguished. However, the algorithms used to transform correlations between pulses and physical
        events into actual events, the so-called detector hits of ions, is a proprietary one. This algorithm is also
        referred to as the hit finding algorithm.
        
        Due to this practical inaccessibility of details, virtually all atom probe studies currently use a reporting
        schema where the course of the specimen evaporation is documented such that quantities are a function of
        evaporation_id i.e. actual event/ion, i.e. after having the hit finding algorithm and correlations applied.
        That is the evaporation_id values take the role of an implicit time and course of the experiment given that
        ion extraction physically is a sequential process.
        
        This application definition includes fields that the atom probe community has decided to represent best practices
        for reporting atom probe measurements. Exemplar mapping tables are provided for documents that reported these
        best practices to translate technical term into concepts of the NXapm application definition.
        
        *The NeXus application definition NXapm defines a hierarchical data model with ten building blocks:*
        
        The data model represents a tree of concepts. The tree is constructed from groups of concepts representing
        the branches, together with fields and attributes representing leaves. NXapm is defined by composing and
        specializing base classes into the following ten categories:
        
        - The field ``definition`` specifies that the data schema is NXapm. In combination with
          administrative metadata such as the attribute ``NeXus_version`` provided by :ref:`NXroot` this
          specifies which version of NXapm the instance data in a NeXus/HDF5 file are compliant with.
        - The fields ``run_number``, ``experiment_alias``, ``experiment_description`` and
          the group ``userID`` provide concepts for storing organizational metadata that
          contextualize the work within the research workflow and humans involved in this.
        - The fields ``start_time``, ``end_time`` provide concepts for framing a temporal context for the research.
        - The groups ``citeID``, ``noteID`` provide concepts for adding contextual details such as citations or notes
          that are associated with the data, i.e. other artifacts that are deemed relevant when reporting about
          a measurement or simulation. These groups are useful when NXapm is used as a serialization format for
          technology-partner-agnostic archival of data and metadata that have been collected during a session with
          an atom probe instrument. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms that refer to an
          uninterrupted period of measurement. Resuming measurement on a specimen after an interruption is viewed
          as a new run and the new data should not be appended to the previous run, but written to either a new NXentry,
          or a new file. Removing the specimen from the instrument is an interruption. Changing evaporation conditions
          while the specimen is remains in the analysis_chamber and resuming thereafter the measurement
          is not considered as an interruption. It is a common strategy to probe the evaporation process for different
          instrument parameters. Each individual collection should then though be stored in an own NXevent_data_apm
          group. Parking the specimen to the buffer_chamber and resuming the measurement at a later stage is an interruption.
          During a run, the microscope is used for a certain amount of time to characterize a single specimen.
        - The groups ``sample`` and ``specimen`` provide concepts for storing metadata about the sample and the specimen,
          i.e. the smaller part that was removed from the sample to be measured in the atom probe session.
          The term "tip" in the context of atom probe research is considered jargon.
          Specimen is an exact synonym for tip.
        - The field ``operation_mode`` and group ``measurement`` provides concepts that
          are useful for describing a measurement during a session with an atom probe or field-ion microscope.
          This includes the chain of events of data and metadata that were collected during such a session.
        - The group ``simulation`` provides concepts that are useful for describing a simulation of an
          atom extraction, ionization, and ion trajectory simulation. Combined with ``measurement``
          this provides a data schema for defining a digital twin of the instrument and its setup.
        - The groups ``consistent_rotations``, and ``NAMED_reference_frame`` provide concepts for
          reporting coordinate systems (frames of reference) and rotation conventions that clarify how data
          should be interpreted specifying the rotation of orientable objects in the microscope, its components,
          or of crystals and crystal defects in the material analyzed.
        - The group ``atom_probeID`` provides concepts for the computational workflows that were
          used to convert raw detector data into reconstructed ion positions and documentation of
          ranging definitions made.
        - The group ``profiling`` provides concepts for reporting computational details such as
          programs and libraries used, for documenting the libraries of virtual environments such as those used
          by conda or python virtual environment, including details about the computing hardware used, and
          documenting capabilities for performance analyses and benchmarking of the software or its parts.
        
        *Design choices:*
        
        Given that most atom probe instruments across the globe were built by AMETEK/Cameca and are delivered
        with the AP Suite/IVAS software there is some homogeneity in how a measurement is performed and which data
        artifacts and algorithms used for data processing. Complementary use of open-source software specifically for
        the reconstruction, ranging, and later data processing stages contributes to a landscape of multiple tools in use.
        Therefore, communication of atom probe research differs between user groups. This holds even more so true
        for the sub community in atom probe which study physical mechanisms involved during ionization to the point that
        here that almost each research work defines different simulation tools with different types of data artifacts.
        
        NXapm defines constraints on the existence and cardinality of concepts and its concept branches but seeks to
        offer a compromise. The key design pattern followed is that most branches are made optional or at most recommended
        but their child concepts are conditionally required. Thereby, NXapm can cover a variety of simple but also complex
        use cases. An example of this parent-optional-but-childs-stronger-restricted design is the combination of the
        optional group ``measurement`` with its required child ``measurement/instrument``:
        Users which report simulations are not forced to document the instrument but users which have characterized
        a specimen are motivated to report about the instrument. They are though not  necessarily required to report all
        the details of the instruments' components because the design pattern is applied recursively.
        
        *NXapm distinguishes and stores instance data based on how long they remain unchanged:*
        
        ``measurement`` provides two groups ``measurement/instrument`` and ``measurement/eventID``.
        The first group is designed for storing metadata about the instrument that do not change over the course of the session.
        Examples are the name of the technology partner who built the microscope or whether a laser or voltage pulser
        and reflectron exists or not. The second group is designed for metadata and data that are collected during
        the session with the instrument. These, are stored as instances of ``measurement/eventID``,
        events that can be time-stamped individually.
        Each instance of a group ``measurement/eventID`` contains ``measurement/instrument`` whose purpose is to
        store those specific state and settings of the instrument that was present during the collection of the event.
        Thereby, changing conditions such as campaigns with different target detection rate can be stored.
        
        Noteworthy, such an approach of the atom probe detecting groups of events and storing these as groups has also
        been in use in the proprietary software via CamecaRoot, a set of customized data structures and file formats that use
        the CernRoot library. By virtue of design this reduces unnecessary repetition of metadata stored in the first group.
        
        ``atom_probeID`` offer classes for the each task relevant task in the data processing pipeline that converts raw detector
        event data to calibrated mass-to-charge-state-ratio values and hit_position on the detector. These include
        ``initial_specimen``, and ``final_specimen`` locations for storing images of the specimen prior/after the measurement as
        considered best practice by AMETEK/Cameca, ``raw_data`` for delay-line timing data, ``hit_finding`` for details of the
        hit finding algorithm, ``hit_spatial_filtering`` a process that filters hits of too low quality and those laying outside the about
        to be computed reconstruction volume. Furthermore, group ``voltage_and_bowl`` offers a place for documenting calibrations
        and processing non-linearities. Group ``mass_to_charge_conversion`` is used to document the mass calibration and the
        conversion from time-of-flight to mass-to-charge-state-ratio values.
        
        Finally, the groups ``reconstruction`` and ``ranging`` were designed to match and document the classical approaches how
        from all the previous sources of input one can compute a reconstructed volume, and apply peak fitting routines on the
        mass-to-charge-state-ratio histogram to label ions, i.e. range them for their isotopic identity.
        Group ``atom_probeID/reconstruction/naive_discretization`` offers a standardized way to report simple
        three-dimensional histograms. Group ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID`` and its
        complementing group ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/ionID/charge_state_analysis``
        solves the issue that the ranging definitions in classical file formats are not reported for always for their isotopic identity
        and charge state. The field ``atom_probeID/ranging/peak_identification/iontypes`` provides a place for
        storing a compact representation of the results of each ranging definition made at the level of each ion.
        
        *The compatibility of NXapm and NXem:**
        
        The design of NXapm mirrors that of :ref:`NXem`. This was an intentional choice to support the increasingly stronger connection between
        these two materials characterization methods, especially in light of recent advances in the direct coupling of atom probe and
        transmission electron microscopes and scanning transmission electron microscopes.

                The identifier whereby the experiment is referred to in the control software.
                
                It is common practice in atom probe research to refer to a measurement on a single
                specimen as a run. When working with AMETEK/Cameca instruments it is a common
                practice also to store all data associated with such a run in files whose name
                is composed from a prefix that details the type of instrument (e.g. R5076) followed
                by the run_number. These filenames are often used as the specimen_name or
                experiment_identifier. The terms run and session are understood as exact synonyms.
                
                For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen,
                or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the identifier which matches
                best conceptually to the LEAP run number.
                
                The field does not have to be required, if the information is recoverable
                in the dataset which for LEAP instruments is the case; provided these
                RHIT or HITS files respectively are stored alongside a data artifact.
                With NXapm the RHIT or HITS can be stored via NXnote in the
                hit_finding algorithm section.
                
                As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
                It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
                while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
                needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
                We follow this habit of most atom probe groups. Such interrupted runs
                should be stored as individual :ref:`NXentry` instances in one NeXus file.

                included when the atom probe session started. If the exact duration of
                the measurement is not relevant, start_time only should be used.
                
                The start_time is required in order to ensure that at least one point in time
                is provided for full temporal context to a measurement and simulation
                when writing instance data using NXapm. Otherwise, the instance data
                can not be sorted in order or even placed in a logical sequence to other
                steps of the research workflow, which would disallow using functionalities
                in research data management systems that rely on temporal context.
                
                Specifying start_time and end_time is useful for capturing more detailed
                bookkeeping of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with
                having both dates specified, it may not be possible to infer how long

                More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
                collected to compute this event chain during the experiment. For this
                purpose the :ref:`NXevent_data_apm` instance should be used.

                Writing the end_time can be a tricky in practice. If written at the start
                of the experiment, it can only be an estimate. If written at the end, there
                is the risk for having the computer crash or lose power. The absence of
                end_time should not be interpreted as that the experiment was aborted.
                Only, the field ``status`` should be used for communicating such abortion.

                A coordinate system. Multiple instances require unique names.
                
                Several Euclidean coordinate systems (CS) are used in the field of atom probe:
                
                * World space;
                  a CS specifying a local coordinate system of the planet earth which
                  identifies into which direction gravity is pointing such that
                  the laboratory space CS can be rotated into this world CS.
                * The laboratory space;
                  a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or
                  a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the
                  transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod
                  has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.
                  In summary, this CS is defined by the chassis of the instrument.
                  Suggested name of the group ``laboratory_reference_frame``.
                * The specimen space;
                  a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,
                  whose z axis points towards the detector.
                  Suggested name of the group ``specimen_reference_frame``.
                * The detector space;
                  a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the
                  detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.
                  This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion
                  positions.
                  Suggested name of the group ``detector_reference_frame``.
                * The reconstruction space;
                  a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.
                  The orientation depends on the analysis software used.
                * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the
                  flight path of individual ions might be defined.
                  Suggested name of the group ``reconstruction_reference_frame``.
                
                To achieve unique names, the prefix "NAMED" should be replaced to
                with something derived from an alias for the coordinate system,
                or the value of the "alias" field.
                
                Use the suffix _reference_frame when creating specific instances
                of NXcoordinate_system e.g. laboratory_reference_frame,
                reconstruction_reference_frame and so on and so forth.
                
                In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
                space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
                stack. This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
                within a predefined evaporation identifier interval. Typically, the set of
                ion evaporation sequence identifiers is grouped into chunks.
                
                For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
                is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
                the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.
                
                To avoid these ambiguities, instances of :ref:`NXtransformations` should be used.

                    For almost all atom probe instruments, the recorded raw data and metadata follow

                    that have been collected during the measurement in an effort to document as best as
                    possible all steps of an analysis workflow.
                    
                    The physical quantities measured in an atom probe experiment are time-of-flight and
                    tuples of arrival_time_pairs as a function of the event chain on the pulser.
                    From these tuples, hits are computed in a process called hit_finding.

                        At least the main software should be reported. If this is the only program

                        It is recommended to report multiple programs though, i.e. also the libraries
                        and dependencies of the software. In the case of AP Suite/IVAS this can be used
                        to document the AP Suite GUI, LAS, CamecaRoot, and CernRoot versions.
                        In this case always name the program groups program1, program2, ...
                        with program one being AP Suite/IVAS.

                        M-TAP instruments, also use program1, program2, ... with program1 representing
