TODO (Workshop output):
- Talk with VIBSO people - possible to syncrhonize raman_experiment_type with this ontology?
- Similar to ellipsometry: Seperate in-situ from resonant/non-resonant stuff: OR maybe allow multiple selections?
- Shorten raman_experiment_type by removal of Raman_spectroscopy, but as well fix the Raman Reader in the same run
- Which for more dataconverters: Output from usualy Raman setups to neXus format?
- Spot size description?
- Descroption of defocusing / maybe as well as experiment_type?

Wishes for NXraman or general next workshop:
"convert excisting data to NeXus"
"dictionary lookup keywords/fields in existing formats"(?)
Template for specific experiments (i.e. too complex to get into NeXus/FAIRdata?) - unclear what to do.
coorporation with VIBSO ontology?

        An application definition for Raman spectrocopy experiments.

        Such experiments may be as simple a single Raman spectrum from spontanous
        Raman scattering and range to Raman imaging Raman spectrometer,
        surface- and tip-enhanced Raman techniques, x-Ray Raman scattering, as well
        as resonant Raman scattering phenomena or multidimenional Raman spectra (i.e.
        varying temperature, pressure, electric field, ....)

        The application definition contains two things:
        1. The structures in the application definition of NXopt:
        * Instrument and data calibrations
        * Sensors for sample or beam conditions

        AND

        2. The strucutres specified and extended in NXraman:
        * description of the experiment type
        * descroption of the setup's meta data and optical elements (source, monochromator, detector, waveplate, lens, etc.)
        * description of beam properties and their relations to the sample
        * sample information

        Information on Raman spectroscopy are provided in:
